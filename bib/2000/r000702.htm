	Robert M. (eds.)&nbsp; <i>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Bob Frankston has long been interested in the possibilities of computers 
	and the assumption that there must be something useful about them.&nbsp; He 
	is best known for implementing VisiCalc (along with Dan Bricklin), the first 
	electronic spreadsheet and the first program to make the personal computer a 
	required business tool.&quot;&nbsp; - From the summary about the contributors.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>The first fifty years (pp.44-51)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Corbat√≥&#39;s law is introduced (p.45):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of lines of code is the same independent of the language 
	used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>[This is an observation about the human grasp of complexity, suggesting 
	that we are limited by the size of the program.&nbsp; As programming 
	languages improve and increase the level of expressions, we can make more 
	powerful programs in the same number of lines.&nbsp; We can attack more 
	difficult problems because their programs are now within our grasp. -- dh:]</p>
  <p>The term &quot;a pride of programmers&quot; is introduced (p.45):</p>
  <p>&quot;Projects that required innovation in too many areas at once were unlikely 
	to succeed.&nbsp; The IBM 360 and the Multics project were notable 
	exceptions and both experienced long delays in delivering on their promises.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The lessons of why these programs were so difficult are still relevant 
	today.&nbsp; Fred Brook&#39;s <i>The Mythical Man Month</i> applies to any 
	complex system, not just a large pride of programmers.&quot;</p>
  <p>Frankston points out a defect of the 1798 Malthusean Law on the limits to 
	population growth (p.45):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We are doomed to starve because population increases exponentially and 
	food supply increases only linearly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The defect is a failure to take into account the nature of change and 
	innovation.&nbsp; In addition (p.46),</p>
  <p>&quot;With computers we have an additional element -- the computers themselves 
	are direct agents in the process of innovation.&quot;</p>
  <p>On the evolution of programming, Frankston makes frequent reference to the 
	transition to descriptive programming.&nbsp; He makes an observation that I 
	can certainly support (p.47):</p>
  <p>&quot;The challenge has shifted from providing the professional programmer with 
	tools to providing the &#39;users&#39; with the tools to interact directly with the 
	computer.&nbsp; The original users of FORTRAN saw themselves as, and they 
	were, scientists and engineers solving their own problems. ...&quot;</p>
  <p>Frankston echoes a theme that is consistent with Computer Programming for 
	Everyone (CP4E), though with a particular solution in mind (p.47):</p>
  <p>&quot;As we&#39;ve expanded the set of &#39;programmers&#39; to include, potentially, anyone 
	using a computer, we&#39;ve also changed the nature of programming.&nbsp; Rather 
	than specify a series of steps, one can give examples or a description of 
	what should be done rather than the detailed steps of how to do it.&quot;</p>
  <p>There is another statement that appeals to the direction programming must 
	take (p.48):</p>
  <p>&quot;It is this ability to use the computer as an agent by &#39;programming&#39; it 
	with behavior that is central to the power of computing.&nbsp; It is 
	important to realize that we have converted the user into a programmer, just 
	as the phone dial converted people (users?) into phone operators.&nbsp; ...</p>
  <p>&quot;Just as there weren&#39;t going to be enough phone operators, there aren&#39;t 
	going to be enough programmers to add the little bits of intelligent 
	behavior we are going to expect of the infrastructure.&nbsp; And it is this 
	limitation imposed by the need to specify behavior that is part of the 
	upcoming challenge.&quot;</p>
  <p>Frankston talks about moving from programming to problem solving.&nbsp; 
	There are some juxtapositions I have not fathomed (p.49):</p>
  <p>&quot;At best, one can prove that two representations of an algorithm are 
	equivalent, but that doesn&#39;t address the question of whether the program 
	meets a vague requirement.&nbsp; The question is whether the program works 
	properly in service of some larger goal.&nbsp; There may, in fact, be 
	multiple conflicting goals.</p>
  <p>&quot;Rather than proving programs correct, we must make them simple enough to 
	understand.&quot;</p>
  <p>I don&#39;t see how this follows, lest it is meant to suggest that the 
	correctness of a program should be evident <i>a priori</i>
  as a consequence of its understandability.</p>
  <p>In discussing Occam&#39;s razor, Frankton argues that &quot;simplification <i>is</i> 
	our goal.&quot;</p>
  <p>Then he says this approach won&#39;t work (p.49):</p>
  <p>&quot;But this begs the question since it just shifts the problem to finding the 
	right representation, which is unsolvable in the general case, both because 
	it reminds us that the nature of the solution is a function of the context 
	in which the problem is being solved (ambiguity) and simply because it is a 
	restatement of general problem solving.&quot;</p>
  <p>So Frankston is led to the idea of iterating and improving a solution.&nbsp; 
	He ends with this (p.49):</p>
  <p>&quot;When we have independent, interacting systems we don&#39;t necessarily have 
	the option of recomposing them.&nbsp; This places a premium on getting an 
	effective representation the first time, but inevitably, the initial 
	solution will need to be adjusted as the situation changes.&nbsp; To the 
	extent we can, we must be prepared for such change.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Becoming the infrastructure</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is more here, building toward the notion of system resiliency, not 
	system correctness, as the appropriate goal.</p>
  <p>To be continued ...</p>
