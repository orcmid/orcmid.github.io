<h1><a name="s1" href="#s1">1</a>. <a name="InitialAssumptions">Initial Assumptions</a></h1> 
<blockquote>
  
<p>Software includes computer programs and what is needed to use them [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 
1.1.1]</p> 
  <p>Software engineering is seen as an engineering discipline concerned with 
  all aspects of software production [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.2] starting 
  from (software) system specification through maintenance of the (software) 
  system after it has gone into use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>This distinction does not provide much about the system of which the 
  software (system) occurs in an instrumental way.&nbsp; Even in the discussion of 
  (computer-based) system engineering, the focus is inward and artifact centric 
  in tone [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.4].</p> 
  <p>The reach is further confirmed by placing software specification as the 
  initial stage of the software process [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.5].&nbsp; 
  It is important that software evolution is included, beyond the validation of 
  the software product against customer requirements.&nbsp; The requirements 
  confirmation process is not itself identified as the leading activity.</p> 
  <p>The software process model is peculiar in that sometimes the notions here 
  apply to the model inside which the delivered software functions, and 
  sometimes the notions are about the activity of software engineering and 
  development [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.6].&nbsp; It is clear from the 
  section that it is the software delivery process that is being considered, and 
  not the functions of the software itself, but it is startling to not have that 
  be so clear in terms of the kinds of models.</p> 
  <p>The limitation of scope is confirmed in regard to the characterization of 
  software engineering methods [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.8].&nbsp; However, 
  the process of moving up to situation in models, via approaches such as Model 
	Driven Architecture (MDA) 
  are still possible in this view.&nbsp; However, MDA may be confined mostly to 
  software engineering, and hence inward-looking still.</p> 
  <p>The attributes of good software are about non-functional metrics with 
  regard to the behaving software [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.10].&nbsp; 
  Usability, and some performance attributes, are the closest that seem to be 
  related to suitability to the task.&nbsp; The prospect for metrics is not 
  introduced at this point.</p> 
  <p>It is interesting to me that the key challenges would seem to require both 
  abstraction and situation of the software, its integration, and its life cycle 
  [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 1.1.11].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>The ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics for software engineers is cited, as is the Fred 
  Brooks &quot;No Silver Bulllet paper. [<a href="#Brooks1995">Brooks1995</a>]</p> 
</blockquote>
  
  <h1><a name="s2" href="#s2">2</a>. Computer-Based System Engineering</h1> 
<blockquote>
  <p>Now we look more closely at the scope of system-engineering around
  computers.</p> 
  
  <p>We want to look for broader system-engineering issues that affect software
  engineering [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: 2, objectives].&nbsp; We also want to
  look at what is meant by the system's environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  <p>&quot;System engineering is the activity of specifying, designing,
  implementing, validating, deploying and maintaining systems <i>as a whole</i>.&nbsp;
  System engineers are [concerned with] software, hardware and the system
  interactions with users and its environment.&nbsp; They must think about the
  services that the system provides, the constraints under which the system must
  be built and operated and the interactions of the system with its
  environment.&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="#SE">SE</a>: p.21]</p> 
  
  <p>The following definition is telling:</p> 
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;A system is a purposeful collection of interrelated components that
    work together to achieve some objective.&quot; [<a href="#SE">SE</a>:
    p.21]</p> 
  
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is emphasis on emergent properties [<a href="#Checkland1981">Checkland1981</a>],
  ones that cannot be attributed to any specific part of the system, emerging
  only when the system as a whole is considered.&nbsp; Examples include physical
  weight, reliability, and usability.&nbsp; There is reference to [<a href="#White1993">White1993</a>]
  as the source of ideas about CBSE (Computer-Based Software Engineering)and also some observations about the growth
  in space-program software systems.</p> 
  
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="s2.1" href="#s2.1">2.1</a> Emergent System Properties</h2> 
  
<blockquote>
  <p>The examples are great:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>Functional properties - like bicycle having the functional property of
      being a transportation device once it has been assembled from its
      components (but notice the missing reference to the rider).</li>
    <li>Non-functional properties such as reliability, performance, safety and
      security.&nbsp; (Also noteworthy if we consider the bicycle with and
      without the rider.)</li>
    <li>For reliability, operator behavior is considered.&nbsp; &quot;Operator
      error is more likely in conditions of stress.&quot; [p.23].&nbsp; Also it
      is noted that observed reliability depends on the context in which the
      system is used.</li>
    <li>Environmentally-related failures and hazards are useful. There is an
      example of a subsystem that must be operated within a particular range of
      temperatures, and that failure of an adjacent air-conditioning unit could
      cause it to be overheated out of proximity to the malfunctioning AC!</li>
    <li>Safety and security pose different problems, it is claimed.&nbsp; Here
      the problem is the prediction of the absence of something.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="s2.2" href="#s2.2">2.2</a> Systems and Their Environment</h2>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Considers interactions with and from the physical environment that are
      intended as part of the functioning and that are unintended.</li>
    <li>Looks at organizational environment as well as physical
      environment.&nbsp; &quot;If the organizational environment is not properly
      understood, systems may not meet business needs and may be rejected by
      users and organizational managers.&quot; [SE: 2.2 p.25].</li>
    <li>Looks at impact on people including changes of processes and training
      requirements, deskilling or otherwise changing how people work, and
      organizational impact.&nbsp; Refers to [Mumford1989], [Checkland1981],
      [Checkland1990], and [Ackroyd1992].</li>
    <li>Asserts that it is impossible to anticipate all of the environmental
      factors.</li>
  </ul>
