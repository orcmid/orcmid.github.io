      <dd>Biagi, Enzo.&nbsp; <i>Lettera d'amore a una ragazza di una volta</i>.&nbsp;
        Italian (Love Letter to a [young] woman of another time).&nbsp; Rizzoli
        (Milano: 2003).&nbsp; ISBN 88-17-99506-1.<small><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [dh:2004-02-20] This book is here because it is
        an example of language and what is evoked by words.&nbsp; The title does
        not translate (<i>di una volta</i> - literally of one time or occasion, is an
        expression for &quot;another time,&quot; for example, and <i>ragazza</i>
        started out as female teen-ager).&nbsp; Vicki was speaking with me today
        about what the book is about, because I asked her about the first
        sentence (also on the jacket blurb): «Cara Lucia, non ho altro mezzo
        per rivolgermi a te e ti scrivo una lettera che non leggerai mai.».&nbsp;
        This translates basically to &quot;Dear Lucia, I have no other way to
        speak myself to you and I write a letter that you will never
        read.&quot;&nbsp; (All crudeness of translation is mine.)&nbsp; I asked
        Vicki, who is reading the book in her Italian language class, whether
        Lucia has gone away.&nbsp; Vicki told me that the author had a young
        wife and a daughter and the wife died.&nbsp; Later, the daughter
        died.&nbsp;&nbsp; We both teared up.&nbsp; And that is all that I have 
		read of the book - the title, the first sentence, and spoken with Vicki 
		about what the book is about.&nbsp; I will speak of this somewhere
        in regard to language and situating meaning.&nbsp; When I read over this
        paragraph, I am moved to weep also.&nbsp; It reminds me of the first
        time I saw Michelangelo's <i>Pieta</i> at the Vatican exhibition of the
        1964 New York World Fair. [2023-09-10 touch-up]<br>

      <dd>Crichton, Michael.&nbsp; <i>Travels</i>. Alfred A. Knopf (New York:
        1988).&nbsp; HarperCollins Perennial edition ISBN 0-06-050905-8 pbk.<small><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [dh:2004-04-08]&nbsp;This book recounts author
        Crichton's personal journey of self-discovery.&nbsp; On the way, he also
        traveled to places.&nbsp; The desire to experience new places and step
        into the unfamiliar is presented in terms of experiences that provided
        insight into himself, others, and how we relate to one another.&nbsp; My
        wife read the book first and said I would particularly enjoy the last
        chapter.&nbsp; I have the book because Lion Kimbro quoted something
        Crichton says about science and I asked where the source could be
        found.&nbsp; Lion says he rereads the last two chapters.&nbsp; After
        checking reader reviews on amazon.com, I was a little concerned about
        mentions of the paranormal and other new-age-sounding content.&nbsp; I
        couldn't imagine what that would be about, so I resolved to find
        out.&nbsp; I need not have been concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the &quot;Postscript: Skeptics at Cal
        Tech&quot; first.&nbsp; Then I read the book from the beginning.&nbsp;
        The most difficult part was reading about Crichton's experiences as a
        medical student, especially with his observations about contemporary
        superstitions fresh in my mind.&nbsp; In some parts of this book, I feel
        sad, in other parts I weep, and mostly I am grateful for the simple
        generosity with which the author exposes his continuing discovery of
        himself.&nbsp; The author is very gentle about not imposing his
        experience while owning it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I teach Computers101 for undergraduates,
        especially budding computer scientists, I will assign this book and not
        tell them why.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [2023-09-10 Later, Crichton will disavow this book.&nbsp; 
		I am unclear why.&nbsp; Now I think the disavowal that I encountered has 
		been removed. More at

        </small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2002-11-29: At one point, there
        was a slightly damaged edition of this text on the web.&nbsp; Apparently
        that and <i>Tools for Conviviality</i> have now been removed.&nbsp; I
        ordered this book because it is readily available and I wanted to see
        the passages that were omitted in the on-line transcription.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illich's writings had been proposed for review by a discussion group on
        the Bootstrap Alliance list, and that was when I began to read some of
        the works the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I notice is his challenge to
        basic assumptions.&nbsp; Whether or not I am comfortable with the
        prognosis or the rationale, Illich confronts me with assumptions that
        deserve to be questioned.&nbsp; One of the greatest perils that he
        addresses is the creation of social institutions that, ultimately, end
        up delivering the very thing that they were created to overcome.&nbsp;
        That we be that we are providing one thing when the result is observably
        the other is something that deserves constant scrutiny.<br>

        because it was convenient to order at the same time as [<a href="#Illich1970">Illich1970</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;
        What I notice is how much the challenges laid down here in that ripe
        period, 35 years ago, remain present, and how much the evidence for our
        deviation and the desperateness of our defense has grown in the
        meantime.&nbsp; My wife and I just returned from watching the film <i>Bowling
        for Columbine</i>.&nbsp; We are the most dangerous victims on the
        planet.&nbsp; It is not comfortable to look at.&nbsp; And others pay a

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if this is a (political)

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard the author speak one time in Mountain
        View, while on a tour promoting this or the next book, I no longer
        recall.&nbsp; I had owned the first Book, and once I was told the
        message, I did not have any need to complete reading it.&nbsp; According
        to Walsch, there are three messages in Book 1: (1) we are one; (2) there
        is enough; and (3) there is no such thing as right and wrong.&nbsp; I
        didn't stop because I had a problem with that.&nbsp; I stopped because I
        &quot;got it,&quot; as we say.&nbsp; For this volume, Walsch spoke about
        education and reform of education around three core concepts or values:
        awareness, honesty, and responsibility.&nbsp; I couldn't remember what
        those were precisely, yet the idea was so compelling that I finally
        ordered the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased that I ordered the book for
        another reason.&nbsp; Some of the review published on amazon.com must
        not be from people who read even as little as the back cover of either
        volume.&nbsp; And, if it disturbs you that Adolf Hitler went to heaven,
        you are probably not ready for this conversation.&nbsp; But you should
        not dismiss it.&nbsp; The conversation is ready for you.&nbsp; In the
        current American era of the world, it is important to express this
        message more loudly, perhaps.&nbsp; -- dh:2003-07-17.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yet you will not have, cannot produce,
        the society of which you have always dreamed unless and until you see
        with wisdom and clarity the ultimate truth: that what you do to others,
        you do to yourself; what you fail to do for others, you fail to do for
        yourself; that the pain of others is your pain, and the joy of others
        your joy, and that when you disclaim any part of it, you disclaim a part
        of yourself.&quot; -- from the dust jacket.<br>

        and humility in that.&nbsp; -- dh:2003-07-17.</small></dd>

      <dd>Watts, Alan Wilson.&nbsp; <i>The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing
        Who You Are</i>.&nbsp; Pantheon Books (New York: 1966).&nbsp; Vintage
        Books Edition (New York: 1989).&nbsp; ISBN 0-679-72300-5 pbk.<font size="-1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This book explores an unrecognized but
        mighty taboo--our tacit conspiracy to ignore who, or what, we really
        are.&nbsp; Briefly, the thesis is that the prevalent sensation of
        oneself as a separate ego enclosed in a bag of skin is a hallucination
        which accords neither with Western science nor with the experimental
        philosophy-religions of the East--in particular the central and germinal
        Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism.&nbsp; This hallucination underlies the
        misuse of technology for the violent subjugation of man's natural
        environment and, consequently, its eventual destruction.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We are therefore in urgent need of a
        sense of our own existence which is in accord with the physical facts
        and which overcomes our feeling of alienation from the universe.&nbsp;
        For this purpose I have drawn on the insights of Vedanta, stating them,
        however, in a completely modern and Western style--so that this volume
        makes no attempt to be a textbook on or introduction to Vendanta [sic]
        in the ordinary sense.&nbsp; It is rather a cross-fertilization of
        Western science with an Eastern intuition.&quot;&nbsp; From the Preface,
