<blockquote>

<p align="left">Bill and I decided that we need to be disciplined at
working through this book.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also seems that we could make an
useful contribution by identifying
and locating many of the source materials as well as more-recent information (e.g., an
error in the Shostok prover that was uncovered after all this time).&nbsp; In
particular, we want to see what we can find on-line in terms of fundamental
materials that we and others may wish to confirm themselves.</p>


<p align="left">The following reading-plan/syllabus is broken into arbitrary
week-long chunks.&nbsp; I hope we can best that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The extensive notes
of the book need to be reviewed along with the corresponding chapters. My
intention is to link further notes and resources here.</p>

<h1><a name="1">1</a>. Knowing Computers</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Benefits of computerization clear and compelling.</p>
  <p>Dependence comes with it.&nbsp; Reliance in safety-critical systems.</p>
  <p>Tension that results: enthusiasm (.com) and fear (millennium bug).</p>
  <p>How can we know the computing we depend upon is dependable?</p>
  <p>Broader question: How do we know the properties of the natural world, of
  artifacts?</p>
  <p>For computers, how do we know the properties of computers and the programs
  that run on them?&nbsp; Brings focus to deduction.</p>
</blockquote>
  <h2>1.1 Sources of Knowledge [p.2]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Offers a definition of three categories of sources of knowledge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>induction - we learn the properties by observation, experiment, and
      (especially in the case of artifacts) testing and use</li>
    <li>authority - people whom we trust tell us what the properties are</li>
    <li>deduction - we infer the properties from other beliefs, for example by
      deducing them from theories or models</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MacKenzie sites his <a href="r020100b.htm#MacKenzieDonald1996">1996 paper</a>
  for this.</p>
  <p>Deductive proof at the core of mathematics and formal logic.&nbsp; That
  propositions can be proved, not simply justified empirically, is at the heart
  of the claim to provide more secure knowledge than the natural sciences.</p>
  <p>It is often assumed that there is nothing sociological that can be said
  about proof, which is ordinarily taken to be an absolute matter.</p>
</blockquote>
  <h2>1.2 Why deductive proof important in computing? [pp. 2-4]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Influential current of thought within computer science is that inductive
  knowledge of computer systems is inadequate, especially in areas where systems
  are critical to human safety or security.</p>
  <p>Authority is weak, absent an established profession of software engineering
  or the like.</p>
  <p>Alternative often seen as being deductive proof.</p>
  <p>MacKenzie seizes on the key elements:</p>
  <table border="2" cellspacing="3" width="90%" bordercolor="#000080" bordercolordark="#000080" bordercolorlight="#0000FF">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF">If
        one could,
        <ul>
          <li>first, construct a faithful mathematical representation of what a
            program or hardware design was intended to do (in the terminology of
            computing, construct a &quot;formal specification&quot;) and,</li>
          <li>second, construct a mathematical representation of the actual
            program or hardware design, then&nbsp;</li>
          <li>perhaps one could prove deductively that the program or design was
            a correct implementation of its specification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It would not be a proof that the program or design was in an absolute
        sense &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;dependable,&quot; because the
        specification might not capture what was required for safety, security,
        or some other desired property, and because an actual physical computer
        system might not behave in accordance with even the most detailed
        mathematical model of it.</p>
        <p>All of those involved in the field would acknowledge that these are
        questions beyond the scope of purely deductive reasoning.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<h2>1.3 The Computer and Proof [pp. 4-5]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>More useful concepts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Formal verification is proof about computers (this being how the term is
      applied in the formal verification community)</li>
    <li>Distinct is the use of computers in proof
      <ul>
        <li>automated theorem proving and proof checking</li>
        <li>inference engines in artificial intelligence applications</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>1.4 Interrelationships of Computing, Risk, and Proof [pp.5-7]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The topic of the book.</p>
  <p>Methodology is one of social science.&nbsp; Uses the technical literature
  of computer science and artificial intelligence for factual assertions
  wherever possible, and interviews with the main participants, used primarily
  as evidence of interviewees' opinions and beliefs.</p>
  <p>Does not see the consideration of social factors as diminishing in any way
  the others that play in the conduct of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Welcomes errors on the technical subject being pointed out.&nbsp; Does not
  want cross-disciplinary point scoring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1.5 Risk, Trust, and the Sociology of Proof [pp. 7-13]</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The (sociological) question of one's <b>knowledge</b> of computer-system
  dependability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>1.5.1 Risk and Trust in Societies of High Modernity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Striking feature of the politics of high modernity is the salient place in
  it of issues of technological risk.</p>
  <p>Measured by life expectancy, today's Euro-American world is uniquely safe.</p>
  <p>Patently, however, members of these societies do not always feel safe.</p>
  <p>Comments on invisible hazards and the inability to have direct knowledge,
  thus a reliance on authorities of various kinds and levels of
  trustworthiness.&nbsp; &quot;an invisible potential danger, the seriousness of
  which the layperson's unaided senses cannot judge.&quot;</p>
  <p>The millennium bug is seen as the one main case of widespread fear of the
  computer.</p>
  <p>In the Y2K case, political and business leaders throughout the
  Euro-American world judged the effort essential: not knowing how computer
  systems would behavie was intolerable.</p>
  <p>Trade-off between mathematicization and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; As community
  becomes modernity's society, face-to-face solutions are no longer
  viable.&nbsp; Modernity's &quot;trust in numbers&quot; is a substitute for
  absent trust in people.&nbsp; [<a href="r020100b.htm#PorterTheodoreM1995">Porter</a>]
  argues that &quot;reliance on numbers and quantitative manipulations minimizes
  the need for intimate knowledge and personal trust.&quot;&nbsp; What we trust
  are &quot;systems of technical accomplishment or professional expertise,&quot;
  not particular, personally known people.</p>
  <p style="border: 2 solid #000080">2002-02-03: A Concern: I think the debates
  over the World Trade Organization suggests that the populace does not trust in
  arrangements that have technical merit, if the public perceptions is of a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Also, I am disturbed about the fear of computer viruses and its
  most-peculiar manifestation, the computer-virus hoax message.&nbsp; In fact,
  e-mail-carried hoaxes of all kinds are problematical for me.&nbsp; What I
  haven't got my grip on is the willingness of people to forward these to all of
  their friends, often with the appearance of testimony to the message's
  authenticity, when it is not difficult to impeach the authenticity and the
  authority of the message. -- dh.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is pointed out that within scientific communities, there are systems of
  trust based on degrees of personal knowledge of others, however.&nbsp; There
  is need for honest testimony and skillful experimentation.</p>
  <p>No matter how much confidence scientists have had in empirical methods and
  trustworthy testimony, they have conceded deductive proof as providing surety
  of the truth of a conclusion without consulting experience.</p>
  <p>There is Hume's observation that &quot;there is no ... mathematician so
  expert in his science, as to place entire confidence in any truth immediately
  upon his discovery of it.&quot;</p>
  <p>But now we have machines for checking of proofs.&nbsp; Leading us from
  trust in people to trust in machines.</p>
  <p>It is interesting that if a computer is able to operate without
  socialization, and be an expert in a human field, this can be a demonstration
  that socialization is not the only way to accomplish that.&nbsp; &quot;If
  machines can prove, does it mean that proof is not social?&quot;</p>
