<h1>Notes on the Book</h1>  
<blockquote>  
  
<p>These are undistilled notes from reading the book.&nbsp; They are mostly as 
quotations, with an organization along my theme, not Körner's.&nbsp; These 
notes are also not digested, which will be the second stage of the note.&nbsp; I 
have found, in the reading, that I have found some clarity, and now want to 
refine it to a summary of what I make of it, rather than so much of what Körner 
has said in this place and that.&nbsp; --dh:2002-08-05.</p> 
 
<p>&quot;Since the philosophy of mathematics is mainly concerned with the  
exhibition of the structure and function of mathematical theories, it would seem  
to be independent of any speculative or metaphysical assumptions.&nbsp; Yet it  
may be doubted whether such autonomy is even in principle possible ...  
.&quot;&nbsp; from the Introduction, p.11.</p>  
  
<p>&quot;As regarding pure mathematics I propose to argue that the concepts and 
statements of any (existing) mathematical theory are--in a precise sense of the 
terms--purely exact, that they are disconnected from perception, and that in so 
far as a mathematical theory contains existential statements these, unlike, <i>e.g.</i>, 
empirical and theological statements of existential import, are not 
unique.&nbsp; As regards applied mathematics I shall, roughly speaking, argue 
that the 'application' of pure mathematics consists in interchanging perceptual 
and purely exact statements in the service of a given purpose.&quot;&nbsp; The 
Nature of Pure and Applied Mathematics, p.159.</p> 
 
<p>&quot;Each of the philosophies of mathematics which I discussed declares the 
whole or part of classical mathematics to be in some way defective, proclaims 
the need for replacing the defective by sound mathematical theories, and tries 
to meet the need by actual construction.&nbsp; All agree that the 
set-theoretical antinomies are not only obvious defects of classical 
mathematics, but also symptoms of deeper lying defects which they diagnose in 
different ways.&nbsp; The arguments used in the diagnosis are ... mainly 
philosophical arguments, <i>i.e</i>., arguments which belong neither to natural 
science or to logic.&quot;&nbsp; The Nature of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 
p.185.</p>

<blockquote>  
<p>I did not expect to find so much here on this aspect.&nbsp; But there is a 
big question on what it is that mathematical language is language about, and 
also its relationship to perceptions in the world.&nbsp; I don't think I need to 
make so much of it, although the historical perspective is extremely valuable, 
and something to explore more deeply as occasions permit.&nbsp; I think there is 
something about where things start.&nbsp; That is, it seems perfectly possible 
to theorize for its own sake, and not with any connection to the world or 
perceptions.&nbsp; This may not matter here. -- dh:2002-08-05</p>  
<p>&quot;One of the strange features of mathematics, at least since Leibniz, is   
that, in spite of the certainty of its truths, it is by no means generally   
agreed of what, if anything, the true propositions of mathematics are   
true.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.16.</p>   
<p>&quot;For Plato ... applied mathematics describes empirical objects and their   
relations, in so far as they approximate to (participate in) the mathematical   
Forms and their relations.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.18.</p>   
<p>&quot;According to Aristotle, the form or essence of any empirical object, an   
apple or a plate, constitutes a part of it in the same way as does its matter.   
...<br>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aristotle distinguishes sharply between the possibility of abstracting   
(literally 'taking away') unity, circularity and other mathematical   
characteristics from objects and the independent existence of these   
characteristics or their instances, i.e., units and circles.&nbsp; He frequently   
emphasizes that the possibility of abstraction does by no means entail the   
independent existence of that which is, or can be, abstracted.&nbsp; The subject   
matter of mathematics is those results of mathematical abstraction which   
Aristotle calls 'mathematical objects.'&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.18.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Indeed it would not even be possible for [Aristotle] to speak of a   
  true or false idealization, but rather of one which would be more or less   
  adequate for some given purpose.&quot; Some Older Views, p.19.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Aristotle also pays more attention than Plato did to the structure of   
  whole theories in mathematics as opposed to isolated propositions.&nbsp; Thus   
  he distinguishes clearly between (i) the principles which are common to all   
  sciences (or, as we might nowadays say, the principles of formal logic which   
  are presupposed in the formulation and deductive development of any science);   
  (ii) the special principles which are taken for granted by the&nbsp;   
  mathematician engaged in the demonstration of theorems; (iii) the definitions,   
  which do not assume that which is defined exists, e.g., Euclid's definition of   
  a point as that which has no parts; and (iv) existential hypotheses, which   
  assume that what has been defined exists -- independently of our thought and   
  perception.&nbsp; Existential hypotheses in this sense would seem not to be   
  required for pure mathematics.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.20.</p>   
  <p>&quot;[Leibniz] anticipated modern movements, in particular modern logicism,   
  by bringing logic and mathematics together. ... One the one hand he presents a   
  philosophical thesis concerning the differences between truths of reason and   
  truths of fact, and their mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive   
  character.&nbsp; On the other hand he introduces the methodological idea of   
  using mechanical calculation in aid of deductive reasoning, not only within   
  those disciplines which belong traditionally to mathematics, but also beyond   
  them.&nbsp; This means, in particular, the introduction of calculation into   
  logic.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.22.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Another difficulty concerning truths of fact arises from the   
  principle of sufficient reason 'which affirms that <i>nothing takes place</i>   
  with out sufficient reason, that is to say nothing happens without its being   
  possible for one who should know things sufficiently, to give a reason which   
  is sufficient to determine why things are so and not otherwise.'&nbsp; This is   
  for Liebniz not merely a general injunction to look for sufficient reasons to   
  the best of one's ability, but in some ways, like the principle of   
  contradiction, it is a principle of inference and analysis.&quot;&nbsp; Some   
  Older Views, p.23.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Mathematical propositions to [Liebniz] are like logical propositions   
  in that they are not true of particular eternal objects or of idealized   
  objects resulting from abstraction or indeed of any kind of object.&nbsp; They   
  are true because their denial would be logically impossible.&nbsp; Despite   
  every prima facie appearance to the contrary, a mathematical proposition is as   
  much or as little 'about' a particular object or class of objects as is the   
  proposition 'If anything is a pen it is a pen' about my particular pen, or   
  about the class of pens, or the class of physical objects or any other class   
  of objects.&nbsp; We might say that both propositions are necessarily true of   
  all possible objects, of all possible states of affairs, or, using the famous   
  Liebnizian phrase, <i>in all possible worlds</i>.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older   
  Views, p.23.</p>   
  <p>&quot;[Liebniz] must have found ... that the discovery of a symbolism for   
  the representation of statements and demonstrations on the one hand, and the   
  insight into their logical structure on the other, though separable in   
  thought, are very rarely separable in fact.<br>   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The concrete representation, in suitable symbols, of a complicated   
  deduction is, in [Leibniz's] words, a 'thread of Ariadne' which leads the   
  mind.&nbsp; Leibniz's programme is first of all to devise a method of so   
  'forming and arranging characters and signs, that they represent thoughts,   
  that is to say that they are related to each other as are the corresponding   
  thoughts.'&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.25.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Frege [introduces] his own notion of an <i>analytic</i>   
  proposition:&nbsp; A proposition is <i>analytic</i> if it can be shown to   
  follow merely from general laws of logic <i>plus</i> definitions formulated in   
  accordance with them.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.33.</p>   
<p>&quot;According to Frege numbers are logical objects which it is the task of   
a philosophy of mathematics to point out clearly.&nbsp; To define them is not to   
create them, but to demarcate what exists in its own right.&nbsp; Contextual   
definition of logical objects will not do because it does not exhibit their   
character as independent entities.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.36.</p>   
<p>&quot;But if arithmetic is deducible from logic, then the deduced   
arithmetical propositions can hardly be assertions about objects of any kind;   
not, at any rate, if, as Russell holds, logic has no subject matter.&nbsp; It   
(a) must be shown that the phrases which seem to represent entities (the   
so-and-so, the class of all things such that ...), whenever they occur in the   
deduction of arithmetic from logic, are embedded in contexts, which do not imply   
the assumption that such mental objects exist; and (b) these contexts must be   
defined.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.35.</p>   
<p>&quot;Russell's way of dealing with the impression--correct or   
incorrect--that in talking about classes we are not talking about entities is   
similar to his theory of descriptions.&nbsp; Again, 'the class of objects which   
...', which seems to name an entity, is absorbed into contexts, each of which is   
defined as a whole and is free from the existential implications which Russell   
desires to avoid.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.36</p>   
<p>&quot;Whether or not we accept this view--that all true propositions denote   
(are names of) the truth-value T and all false propositions denote (are names   
of) the truth-value F--is not the issue.&nbsp; The point is that in so far as we   
regard a proposition as a truth-function of its components, we must take account   
only of their truth or falsehood and ignore any other information which it or   
its components may convey.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.41.</p>   
<p>&quot;Because of its importance for logic and the philosophy of logicism the   
point is worth emphasizing that truth-functions are a very special and abstract   
kind of compound proposition, a type which in some respects represents <i>certain</i>   
features of English and other natural languages ... but which in other respects   
are idealizations and simplifications ... .&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic,   
pp.41-42.</p>   
<p>&quot;The last group of postulates needed to carry out the Frege-Russell   
programme concern the use of the terms 'all' and 'some' in mathematics.&nbsp;   
These were the last part of the logical apparatus to be formalized.&nbsp; The   
need for them becomes very clear when we consider the transition from statements   
in which a property is asserted of one individual object, to statements in which   
the same property is asserted of a finite number of objects, and thence to   
statements in which it is asserted of an actually infinite number.&quot;&nbsp;   
Mathematics as Logic, p.47.</p>   
<p>&quot;The search, however, for such a general characteristic ... as would   
cover both logic and mathematics has, so far, been unsuccessful--which is   
perhaps the least surprising, in view of the pragmatic principles included among   
the postulates of logicist systems, especially principles which are almost   
indistinguishable from empirical hypotheses about the universe.&quot;&nbsp;   
Mathematics as Logic: Criticism, p.57.</p>  
<p>&quot;The formalist not only needs the assurance that his formalism   
formalizes a consistent theory, but also that it completely formalizes what it   
is meant to formalize.&nbsp;&nbsp; A formalism is complete, if every formula   
which--in accordance with its intended interpretation--is provable within the   
formalism, embodies a true proposition, and if, conversely, every true   
proposition is embodied in a provable formula.&quot;&nbsp; The Science of Formal   
Systems, pp.76-77.</p> 
<p>&quot;Since the concepts of metamathematics and the statements in which these 
concepts are applied are not empirical, their subject-matter is also not 
empirical.&nbsp; The strokes on paper and the operations upon them are just as 
little the subject-matter of metamathematics as figures and constructions on 
paper are the subject-matter of Euclidean geometry.&nbsp; Both types of marks 
and constructions are diagrammatic; and diagrams, however useful and practically 
indispensable, are 'representations' which are neither identical nor isomorphic 
with that they are used to 'represent'.&nbsp; ... (I have put 'represent' in 
quotes in order to indicate that I am not using the term in its (now perhaps) 
dominant sense implying isomorphism between representing and represented 
system.&nbsp; The inexactness of the empirical and the exactness of the 
non-empirical concepts precludes isomorphism between the instances and relations 
of the two systems.)&quot;&nbsp; The Science of Formal Systems: Criticism, 
pp.104-105.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;If no two people can live through the <i>same</i> experience, 
then the experience, not being intersubjective, cannot ever validate the 
intersubjective statements of any science.&nbsp; For example, there can be no 
intersubjective science of introspective psychology, and no intersubjective 
science of mathematics as reporting intuitive constructions.&quot;&nbsp; 
Intuitive Construction: Criticism, p.137.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said that the postulation of objects for internally consistent 
concepts is the foundation of mathematical existence-propositions.&nbsp; This 
does not imply any answer to the question whether one should actually postulate 
such objects in a given case.&nbsp; ... What has been said about 
existence-propositions in mathematics seems very much in line with the notions 
of working mathematicians.&nbsp; Indeed their use of the term 'existence-<i>postulate</i>' 
suggests quite clearly the non-uniqueness of mathematical 
existence-propositions.&quot;&nbsp; The Nature of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 
p.176.</p>
<p>On applied mathematics, there is a quotation of Dirac, from <i>The Principles 
of Quantum Mechanics</i>, 1956, &quot;The new scheme becomes a precise physical 
theory when all the axioms and rules of manipulation governing the mathematical 
quantities are specified and when in addition certain laws are laid down 
connecting physical facts with the mathematical formalism, so that from any 
physical conditions equations between the mathematical quantities can be 
inferred and vice versa. .... The justification for the whole scheme depends 
apart from internal consistency on the agreement of the final results with 
experiment.&quot;&nbsp; (Körner p.177)</p>
<p>&quot;The procedure of theoretical physics and of applied mathematics in 
general is to <i>replace</i> empirical propositions by mathematical ones, to 
deduce mathematical consequences from the mathematical premisses, and to replace 
some of these consequences by empirical propositions.&nbsp; That this procedure 
can be, and has often been, highly successful depends on the world's being what 
it is.&nbsp; That satisfiable rules governing--more or less strictly--the 
interchange of exact and inexact concepts (before and after mathematical 
deduction) have been found, depends on those features of the world which go 
under the name of human ingenuity.&quot;&nbsp; The Nature of Pure and Applied 
Mathematics, p.180.</p>
<p>&quot;In choosing a criterion of the soundness of a physical or mathematical 
theory one chooses a programme for the construction of theories.&nbsp; ... In 
the case of mathematical theories the control by experience, if any, is at most 
quite indirect; and the choice is determined more by metaphysical convictions, 
allegedly based on insights into the nature of 'reality', or on sound practice 
and tradition.&nbsp; These become effective as regulative principles, <i>i.e</i>. 
as rules of conduct--the area of conduct being the construction of mathematical 
theories.&quot;&nbsp; The Nature of Pure and Applied Mathematics, p.184.</p>

<h1>1. <a name="AcceptingNumberPrinciple">Accepting the Number Principle</a></h1> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;[Aristotle] distinguishes between the possibility of adding a further  
  unit to the last member of any sequence of numbers, such as in particular the  
  sequence of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, ... and the possibility of making always  
  another subdivision of, say, a line between two points, which had previously  
  been subdivided any number of times.&nbsp; Here the possibility of going on <i>ad  
  infinitum</i> is what may be meant by calling the sequence infinite, or the  
  line 'infinitely' divisible (consisting of infinitely many parts).&nbsp; This  
  is the notion of potential infinity.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.20.</p>  
  <p>&quot;Kant's account of the propositions of pure arithmetic is similar to  
  his account of pure geometry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposition that by adding 2  
  units to 3 units we produce 5 units describes--synthetically and a  
  priori--something constructed in time and space, namely the succession of  
  units and their collection. ... The logical possibility of alternative  
  arithmetics is not denied.&nbsp; What is asserted is that these systems would  
  not be descriptions of perceptual space and time.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older  
  Views, p.29.</p>  
  <p>&quot;Kant's notion of construction as providing the instances of  
  mathematical concepts, the internal consistency of which is granted, assumed,  
  or, at least, not called into question, has many recognizable descendants in  
  later developments in the philosophy of mathematics.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older  
  Views, p.29.</p>  
  <p>&quot;In a mathematical sequence or progression a rule tells us how to take  
  each step after the previous one has been taken.&nbsp; Kant will not allow the  
  assumption that when such a rule is given the totality of all the steps is  
  necessarily in some sense also given.&nbsp; The issue is particularly  
  important in cases when there is no last step or where there is no first  
  step.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.30.</p>  
  <p>&quot;According to [Aristotle] not only are there no instances of actual   
  infinity within sense-experience; it is logically impossible that there should   
  be.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.30.</p>   
  <p>&quot;Let us consider a concept '<var>n</var> is a Natural Number' which is   
  so defined that it does <i>not</i> entail '<var>n</var> has a unique immediate   
  successor'.&nbsp; In other words, we admit the possibility, envisaged by   
  Russell, that the number-sequence comes to an end.&nbsp; Moreover if there is   
  a last Natural Number we assume it to be so great that no one--whether   
  scientist or grocer--needs to be perturbed about it.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics   
  as Logic: Criticism, p.59</p>  
  <p>&quot;Let us consider next the concept '<var>n</var> is a natural number'   
  which is so defined that it <i>does</i> entail '<var>n</var> has a unique   
  immediate successor', and, therefore, ''<var>n</var> has infinitely many   
  successors'.&nbsp; <i>This</i> concept may not be applicable to groups of   
  perceptual objects.&quot; p.59</p>  
  <p>&quot;Moreover, the hypothesis of the infinite sequence of natural numbers   
  by which the concept 'natural number' is defined and provided with its   
  infinite range admits of no empirical falsification or confirmation.&nbsp; It   
  leaves room for further 'hypothesese' of a similar kind, one of which 'assures   
  us' that the class of natural numbers is completely given, another that in   
  addition the class of its subclasses is also given.&nbsp; But there are also   
  hypotheses which assure us to the contrary.&nbsp; This freedom of defining   
  mutually inconsistent concepts and of <i>providing them by definition</i> with   
  different ranges shows us that none of these concepts is empirical.&nbsp; The   
  Natural Numbers on the other hand are empirical concepts, characteristics of   
  perceptual patterns, such as groups of strokes or of temporally separated   
  experiences.&nbsp; They and their relationship to each other are found, not   
  postulated.&quot; p.60.</p>  
  <p>&quot;My aim in this section has been to show that the logicist account of   
  applied mathematics implies an illegitimate conflation of mathematical number   
  concepts and of corresponding empirical ones.&nbsp; Ignoring the difference   
  between the corresponding concepts, logicism cannot, and does not, say   
  anything about the nature of this correspondence.&quot;&nbsp; pp.61-62.</p>  
</blockquote>  
<h1>2. Accepting Mathematical Induction</h1>  
<blockquote>  
  <p>Here, this is basically a question around rules of inference that lead to   
  use of universal quantification on all of the numbers.&nbsp; It is not singled   
  out (so far).</p>   
  <p>&quot;Again the principle of induction, the most characteristic of all the   
  principles of arithmetic, is, in the words of Hilbert and Bernays not an   
  'independent principle' but 'a consequence which we take from the concrete   
  construction of the figures [of numbers].&quot;&nbsp; The Science of Formal   
  Systems, p.78.</p>  
  <p>This is an odd idea, except we would agree that the expressions in formal  
  systems about arithmetic tend to exhibit the quality of number in their  
  forms.&nbsp; However, K&ouml;rner raises some questions about finite 
  methods.&nbsp; This is at the heart of it, since we formalize using structures 
  that are similar to the natural numbers, and are left with a problem there 
  about any &quot;reaching beyond,&quot; or even to the boundary.&nbsp; Here is 
  how K&ouml;rner sets it out:&nbsp; -- dh:2002-08-05</p>
  <p>&quot;Elementary arithmetic is the paradigm of mathematical theory.&nbsp; 
  It is an apparatus which produces formulae, and which can be entirely 
  developed by finite means.&nbsp; This statement, however, ... is still 
  needlessly imprecise, and requires an actual and explicit characterization of 
  what is to be meant by 'finite methods'.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;First, every mathematical concept or 
  characteristic must be such that its possession or non-possession by any 
  object can be decided by inspection of either the actually constructed object 
  or the constructive process which would produce the object. ... Thus one is 
  reasonably content with a process of construction which is 'in principle' 
  performable.&nbsp; Indeed it is at this point, namely when the choice arises 
  between making the formalist programme less strict or sacrificing it, that 
  some relaxation of the finite point of view may be expected.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Secondly, a truly universal proposition--a 
  proposition about all stroke-expressions for example--is not finite: no 
  totality of an unlimited number of objects can be made available for 
  inspection, either in fact or 'in principle'.&nbsp; It is, however, 
  permissible to interpret any such statement as being about each constructed 
  object.&nbsp; Thus, that all numbers divisible by four are divisible by two 
  means that if one constructs an object divisible by four, this object will 
  have the property of being divisible by two.&nbsp; Clearly this assertion does 
  not imply that the class of all numbers divisible by four is actually and 
  completely available.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thirdly, a truly existential proposition--to 
  the effect, <i>e.g.</i>, that there exists a stroke-expression with a certain 
  property--is equally not finite: we cannot go through <i>all</i> 
  stroke-expression (of a certain kind) to find one which has the property in 
  question.&nbsp; But we may regard an existential proposition as an incomplete 
  statement to be supplemented by an indication of either of a concrete object 
  which possesses the property or of the constructuve process yielding such an 
  object. ...<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fourthly, the law of excluded middle is not 
  universally valid. ...<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even in elementary arithmetic there is occasion 
  for using, in a restricted way, transfinite methods, in particular the 
  principle of excluded middle. ... &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The science of formal 
  systems. pp.78-80.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>3. Accepting Trans-Finite Sets</h1> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Aristotle's arguments for rejecting the notion of actual infinity have a  
  central idea behind them:&nbsp; &quot;that a method for a step-by-step  
  procedure, <i>i.e.</i> for making the next step if the preceding step has been  
  taken, does not imply that there is a last step, either in thought or in  
  fact.&quot;</p>  
  <p>&quot;The rejection of the notion of actual infinity is regarded as being  
  of little important for the mathematician who, so Aristotle holds, needs only  
  that of potential infinity for the purposes of mathematical demonstration. ...  
  It might possibly be argued that Aristotle admits the possibility of the  
  consistent use of actually infinite sets in a purely mathematical system which  
  is not applicable to the physical universe.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views,  
  p.21.</p>  
  <p>Kant's analysis of infinity &quot;reminds one in many ways of Aristotle's  
  doctrine, except that in Kant the distinction between actual and potential  
  infinity is worked out still more clearly.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views,  
  pp.29-30.</p>  
  <p>&quot;Kant does <i>not</i> regard the notion of actual infinity as  
  logically impossible.&nbsp; It is what he calls an Idea of reason, that is to  
  say an internally consistent notion which is, however, inapplicable to  
  sense-experience since instances of it can be neither perceived nor  
  constructed.&nbsp; Kant's view is that ... we can neither perceive nor  
  construct an actually infinite aggregate.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.30.</p>  
  <p>&quot;This transition from the notion of potential, constructive infinity  
  to the notion of actual, non-constructive infinity is in Kant's view the main  
  root of confusion in metaphysics.&nbsp; Whether it is required, desirable, or  
  objectionable or indifferent <i>within mathematics</i> is a question which  
  divides the contemporary schools of philosophy of mathematics perhaps more  
  radically than any other problem.&quot;&nbsp; Some Older Views, p.31.</p>  
  <p>&quot;In [Frege's famous definition of 'number'] the role placed by the   
  familiar notion of parallel lines is played by the less familiar notion of   
  'similar' concepts.&nbsp; Two sets of objects are similar if, and only if, a   
  one-to-one correspondence can be established between their members.&nbsp; ...   
  Every concept determines, as we have seen, a set of things, namely the set of   
  things falling under it--the extension of the concept.&nbsp; If the sets of   
  things falling under two concepts ... are similar we shall say that the   
  concepts themselves are similar.&quot;<br>   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frege says we may &quot;define the number of a   
  concept, say <var>a</var>, as the range of values (extension) of the concept '<var>&xi;</var>   
  is a concept similar to <var>a</var>'.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, p.38.</p>   
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Now, some of the most important propositional functions in pure   
mathematics, such as '<var>x</var> is an integer' or '<var>x</var> is an   
irrational number', are of ranges which are not finite.&nbsp; They must be   
regarded as infinite, at least potentially.&nbsp; The philosophical   
mathematicians who adopt the Russellian programme regard the ranges of both '<var>x</var>   
is an integer' and '<var>x</var> is an irrational number' as actually infinite,   
and they regard the latter range as being in a clearly definable sense greater   
than the former. ...<br>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Postulates providing the infinite ranges covered   
by the logicist equivalent of the phrases 'for every integer ...' or 'for every   
real number ...' are susceptible to various interpretations.&nbsp; They may be   
regarded as merely technical devices, admissible so long as they are   
demonstrably innocent of leading to contradictions.&nbsp; This is essentially   
the view of Hilbert and his school.&nbsp; They may be regarded, again as   
inadmissible because misrepresenting the nature of mathematics.&nbsp; This is   
essentially the view of Brouwer and his disciples.&nbsp; They may be regarded,   
lastly, as empirical assumptions about the world.&nbsp; ... To say that there is   
an infinite number of individuals in the world would according to Russell be to   
make an empirical statement which may be true or false but which in Principia   
Mathematica is assumed to be true.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic, pp.48-49.</p>   
<p>&quot;The logistic account of the sequence of natural numbers involves the   
assumption of actual infinities.&nbsp; But although logicism, following Cantor,   
employs this notion most liberally by developing a mathematics of infinities of   
various sizes and various internal structures, its mathematical theory is not   
backed by any philosophical theory or analysis.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as   
Logic: Criticism, p.53.</p>   
<p>&quot;[Frege and Russell] are not ... compelled to hold that the similarity   
or lack of it between two classes, <i>i.e.</i> the presence or absence of a   
one-to-one correspondence between their members, can be established in every   
case.&nbsp; But they do assume it to be true for any two classes; either that   
they are or are not similar, even if there is no possible way of fining   
out.&nbsp; The nature of this assumption is, at best, obscure and in need of   
justification.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as Logic: Criticism, p.59.</p>   
  <p>The historical importance of the 'naive' transfinite mathematics, created   
  by Cantor and incorporated almost wholly into <i>Principia Mathematica</i>,   
  can hardly be overestimated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
  <p>&quot;For proving the consistency of a system, two methods are available:   
  the direct and the indirect.&nbsp; In some cases it can be shown by   
  combinatorial means that inconsistent statements are not deducible in a given   
  theory.&nbsp; In other cases, the direct method proceeds by exhibiting a   
  perceptual model of the theory.&nbsp; More precisely it consists (i) in   
  identifying the objects of the theory with concrete objects, (ii) in   
  identifying the postulates with exact descriptions of these objects and their   
  mutual relations, and (iii) in showing that an inference within the system   
  will not lead to any other than exact descriptions.&nbsp; Since mathematics   
  abounds in concepts of actual infinities which cannot be identified with   
  perceptual objects, the use of the direct method is restricted to certain   
  small parts of mathematics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A theory involving actual infinities can--at   
  least <i>prima facie</i>--be tested for consistency only by the indirect   
  method.&nbsp; One proceeds in this by establishing a one-to-one correspondence   
  between (a) the postulates and the theorems of the original theory and (b) all   
  or some of the postulates and theorems of a second theory, which is assumed to   
  be consistent.&nbsp; ... But none of these theories can have a concrete model.<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Amongst indirect proofs of the consistency of   
  any geometical or physical theory the most common are based on arithmetization,   
  <i>i.e.</i> on representing the objects of these theories by real numbers or   
  systems of such. ... But the reducibility to arithmetic of physical and   
  mathematical theories which contain ideal notions, and which cannot be proved   
  consistent by the direct method, raises the question of the consistency of   
  arithmetic itself.&quot;&nbsp; The Science of Formal Systems, p.75.</p>  
  <p>&quot;We now turn to non-elementary arithmetic.&nbsp; The subject-matter of 
  this arithmetical <i>theory</i> is, of course, no longer finite.&nbsp; But may 
  be possible to construct an arithmetical <i>formalism</i>--with 
  statement-formulae and theorem-formulae corresponding ... to statements and 
  theorems of the theory; and this formalism could then be the subject-matter of 
  a metatheory.&nbsp; Since the subject-matter, namely formula-construction, 
  would be finite, the metatheory would be just as finite as elementary 
  arithmetic, from which it would differ only by being about a different kind of 
  perceptual construction.&nbsp; If a formalism corresponding, in the required 
  manner, to the theory of non-elementary arithmetic can be constructed, then we 
  can again, by demonstrating <i>formal</i> consistency of the formalism, <i>eo 
  ipso</i> establish logical consistency of the theory. ... Our next task, 
  therefore, must be to consider the formula-constructing activities, or 
  formalism--both formalisms considered by themselves and formalisms which are 
  at the same time formalizations of theories.&quot;&nbsp; The Science of Formal 
  Systems, p.84.</p>

<h3>Boole</h3>

  <p>&quot;Cantor, the founder of the general theory of classes or sets, defined  
  a set (<i>Menge</i>) as 'a collection of definite, well-distinguished objects  
  of our perception or thought--the elements of the set--into a whole' [<a href="#[Cantor1895]">Cantor1895</a>].  
  ...<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One of the most important and fruitful events in the  
  history of mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics was the  
  discovery that Cantor's logic of classes, by admitting as a class any  
  collection, however formed, leads to contradictions.&nbsp; Their occurrence  
  ... makes it necessary to distinguish between admissible and inadmissible  
  classes ... .&nbsp; The region of thought where such distinctions are  
  imperative is a little like some notorious swamp which no one could drain, and  
  which, consequently, it was imperative to bridge, by whatever artificial means  
  available.&quot;&nbsp; Mathematics as logic, pp.44-45.</p>

<h3>Frege</h3>  
<blockquote>  
<p>&quot;Frege's explanation of the analytic character of arithmetic presupposes  
that the general laws of logic, which he lists and uses as premisses, are such  
that would generally and at once be recognized.<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;These laws are propositions which he simply  
enumerates.&nbsp; He does not characterize them by any common feature, such as  
all analytic propositions might be presumed to possess though not always being  
immediately seen to possess it.&nbsp; ...<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The path from the listed initial propositions, by  
inferential steps, to the theorems of arithmetic can be expected to be long,  
especially if every step is to be open to thorough inspection. ... Frege and his  
followers adopted and extended the symbolic representation of deductive  
reasoning used by mathematicians.&nbsp; ... The extension consists on the one  
hand of not only symbolizing the notions used in the traditional branches of  
mathematics but those used in all deductive reasoning; and on the other hand of  
formulating explicitly the permissible rules of inference.&quot;&nbsp;

  <p>&quot;According to Russell, definition is a purely notational device.&nbsp;  
  ... Yet, it is maintained that in at least two ways, definitions,  
  theoretically superfluous though they are, often convey most important  
  information.&nbsp; They imply 'that the <i>definiens</i> is worthy of careful  
  consideration' and further that 'when what is defined is (as often occurs)  
  something already familiar, such as cardinals or other ordinal numbers, the  
  definition contains an analysis of a common idea, and may therefore express a  
  notable advance'.[<a href="#[Russell1925]">Russell1925</a>:p.11ff]&quot;&nbsp;

  function, sum, product, power, limit, derivative, etc. are all definable in   
  terms of our three notational devices: membership, joint denial, and   
  quantification with its variables' [<a href="#[Quine1981]">Quine1981</a>:   
  p.125ff]&nbsp; Definition here may be both explicit or contextual, and does

  <h3>Curry</h3>

  <p>&nbsp;&quot;According to Curry, who is quite explicit on this question, we

  <i>acceptability</i> of the system as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; The former is 'an 
  objective matter about which we can all agree; while the latter may involve 
  extraneous considerations'.&nbsp; Thus he holds that 'the acceptability of 
  classical analysis for the purposes of application in physics is ... 
  established on pragmatic grounds and neither the question of intuitive 
  evidence nor that of a consistency proof has any bearing on this matter.&nbsp; 
  The primary criterion of acceptability is empirical; and the most important 
  considerations are adequacy and simplicity'. ... The domain of formal theories

<h3><b>Brouwer</b></h3>

  <p>&quot;According to Brouwer the principles of classical logic are linguistic

  guided by experience'.&nbsp; This means that the rules of classical logic are 
  employed in description and communication but not in the activity itself of 
  constructing; as they are not employed, except as inessential aids, in the 
  activity of mountain climbing.&nbsp; Mathematics is essentially independent, 
  in this sense, not only of language but also of logic.&quot;&nbsp; Intuitive
