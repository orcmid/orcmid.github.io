<p>My interest is in the context of theorizing about theories.&nbsp; I want to 
see the standing that Whitehead, at the turn of the past century, and 
afterwards, gives to mathematics as a theory building activity.</p>

<h1><a name="s1" href="#s1">1</a>. The Abstract Nature of Mathematics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>W starts out concerned about being able to disentangle the fundamental ideas 
of mathematics from the technical procedures which are used among 
mathematicians.&nbsp; p.1</p>
<p>Whitehead sees mathematics as a science and &quot;necessarily the foundation of 
exact thought as applied to natural phenomena.&quot;&nbsp; p.2.</p>
<p>He gets into separation of feelings, emotions, and other subjective aspects 
of perception, and has mathematics dealing with things just because they are 
things, p.2.&nbsp; He seems to suggest that numbers are things, and at least 
that arithmetic applies to everything: &quot;Of all things it is true that two and 
two make four.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is worth while to spend a little thought in getting at the root reason 
why mathematics, because of its very abstractness, must always remain one of the 
most important topics for thought.&nbsp; Let us try to make clear to ourselves 
why explanations of the order of events necessarily tend to become 
mathematical.&quot;&nbsp; p.3.</p>
<p>Observes the orderliness of nature, and interconnection.&nbsp; p.4.</p>
<p>&quot;The laws satisfied by the course of events in the world of external things 
are to be described, if possible, in a neutral universal fashion, the same for 
blind men as for deaf men, and the same for beings with faculties beyond our ken 
as for normal human beings.&quot; p.5.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus it comes about that, step by step, and not realizing the full meaning 
of the process, mankind has been led to search for a mathematical description of 
the properties of the universe, because in this way only can a general idea of 
the course of events be formed, freed from reference to particular persons or to 
particular types of sensation.&quot; p.5</p>
  <p>Here it gets interesting.&nbsp; I would not say we are describing the 
	universe, but the idea of having a theory that stands apart from our 
	individual experience and yet is verifiable intersubjectively would 
	certainly be appropriate.</p>
  <p>There seems to be a confusion with reduction, though, also on p.5.&nbsp; 
	&quot;But in its final analysis, science seeks to describe an apple in terms of 
	the positions and motions of molecules ... .&quot;&nbsp; I would say, if that is 
	what science is seeking to do, it is remarkably unsuccessful.</p>
  <p>To ponder: &quot;This point has usually been misunderstood, from being thought 
	of in too narrow a way.&nbsp; Pythagoras had a glimpse of it when he 
	proclaimed that number was the source of all things.&nbsp; In modern times 
	the belief that the ultimate explanation of all things was to be found in 
	Newtonian mechanics was an adumbration of the truth that all science as it 
	grows towards perfection becomes mathematical in its ideas.&quot; pp.5-6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="s2" href="#s2">2</a>. Variables</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Mathematics as a science commenced when first someone, probably a Greek, 
	proved propositions about <i>any</i> thing or about <i>some</i> things, 
	without specification of definite particular things.&quot;&nbsp; p.7.</p>
  <p>Talks about the use of letters for free variables in algebra.</p>
  <p>Talks about the notion of infinity when &quot;we generalize and say that if
  <var>x</var> be any number there exists some number (or numbers) <var>y</var>
  such that <var>y</var> &gt; <var>x</var>.&quot;&nbsp; p.7.</p>
  <p>There is a tendency to see mathematics as offering descriptions and 
	explanations.&nbsp; I would assert that mathematics provides neither.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="s5" href="#s5">5</a>. The Symbolism of Mathematics</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;For our present purposes ... the history of the notation is a detail.&nbsp; 
	The interesting point to notice is the admirable illustration which this 
	numeral system affords of the enormous importance of a good notation.&nbsp; 
	By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free 
	to concentrate on more advanced problems. ... &quot; p.39</p>
  <p>&quot;It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by 
	eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the 
	habit of thinking of what we are doing.&nbsp; The precise opposite is the 
	case.&nbsp; Civilization advances by extending the number of important 
	operations which we can perform without thinking about them.&nbsp; 
	Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle--they are 
	strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made 
	at decisive moments.&quot;&nbsp; pp.41-42&nbsp; -- Lovely!</p>
  <p>&quot;The symbolism of mathematics is in truth the outcome of the general ideas 
	which dominate the science.&nbsp; We have now two such general ideas before 
	us, that of the variable and that of algebraic form.&quot;&nbsp; p.47.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="s6" href="#s6">6</a>. Generalizations of Number</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whitehead does the construction on the denumerability of the rationals on 
	pp. 53-54.</p>
  <p>Have the index of <var>m</var>/<var>n</var> be <var>m</var>+<var>n</var>.&nbsp; 
	Then proceed through the indices, starting with 2 (1/1) and enumerate all of 
	the rationals having that index. There are always <var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1 
	of them.&nbsp; Within an index, one can order the rationals, starting with 
	1/(<var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1), ..., <var>m</var>/<var>n</var>, ... (<var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1)/1, 
	ordering by numerator.</p>
  <p>He then discusses that Cantor showed the reals are not denumerable.</p>
  <p>Explores generality, for example, working with the integral domain rather 
	than the non-negative natural numbers, even though we end up with negative 
	results of subtractions, having no counter part in the world.&nbsp; This 
	generalization is indispensible, and we have come not to question it.</p>
  <p>Whitehead has his particular finesse -- how to look at the operations of 
	arithmetic -- to allow the generalization for the real field, for example.&nbsp; 
	He describes the difficulties of not doing so:</p>
  <p>&quot;Here are difficulties become acute; for this form [<var>x</var>=<var>b</var>-<var>a</var>] 
	can only be used for the numerical interpretation [of a quantity in the 
	world] so long as <var>b</var> is greater than <var>a</var>, and we cannot 
	say without qualification that <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> may be any 
	constants.&nbsp; ... Really prolonged mathematical investigations would be 
	impossible under such conditions. Every equation would at last be buried 
	under a pile of limitations.&quot;&nbsp; pp.57-58.</p>
  <p>Whitehead proposes a different interpretation that has the signed numbers 
	be operations for adding or taking away.&nbsp; Then x = -3 is fine, because 
	it means it is the taking away of 3.</p>
  <p>We can do that or not.&nbsp; Here is how Whitehead leaves it:</p>
  <p>&quot;The idea of positive and negative numbers has been practically the most 
	successful of mathematical subtleties.&quot;&nbsp; p.60.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After earlier acknowledging the power of introducing 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="s11" href="#s11">11</a>. Functions</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Looks at continuity.&nbsp; Uses the notion of independent variable and the 
	dependent one.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="s17" href="#s17">17</a>. Quantity</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the end,</p>
  <p>&quot;As it is, physical science reposes on the main ideas of number, quantity, 
	space, and time.&nbsp; The mathematical sciences associated with them do not 
	form the whole of mathematics, but they are the substratum of mathematical 
	physics as at present existing.&quot;&nbsp; p.186.</p>
