      <dd>Whitehead, Alfred North.&nbsp; <i>An Introduction to Mathematics</i>.&nbsp;
        Oxford University Press (New York: 1911, 1948).&nbsp; 12th printing of paperback edition
        issued 1958.&nbsp; ISBN 0-19-500211-3.<br>
        <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find this material of
        interest not so much for its mathematical content as for its effort to
        address just what mathematics is that it is important to us, and how
        casting abstractions in mathematical terms provides a way to form a
        general idea of the course of natural events, &quot;to see what is
        general in what is particular and what is permanent in what is
        transitory [p.4].&quot;&nbsp; That is, to abstract the perceived
        orderliness of nature into mathematical theories that are interpreted to
        predict the course of events.&nbsp; I am interested to learn how the
        very idea of mathematics as a device for marshalling abstract theories
        separated from particular interpretations was perceived by someone
        active in the period where this point of view was strengthened so much
        by revolutionary developments in logic and the mathematical language of
        science. -- dh:2002-07-05.<br>

<h1>Notes on the Book</h1>
<blockquote>

<p>My interest is in the context of theorizing about theories.&nbsp; I want to
see the standing that Whitehead, at the turn of the past century, and
afterwards, gives to mathematics as a theory building activity.</p>

<h1><a name="1">1</a>. The Abstract Nature of Mathematics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>W starts out concerned about being able to disentangle the fundamental ideas
of mathematics from the technical procedures which are used among
mathematicians.&nbsp; p.1</p>
<p>Whitehead sees mathematics as a science and &quot;necessarily the foundation
of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena.&quot;&nbsp; p.2.</p>
<p>He gets into separation of feelings, emotions, and other subjective aspects
of perception, and has mathematics dealing with things just because they are
things, p.2.&nbsp; He seems to suggest that numbers are things, and at least
that arithmetic applies to everything: &quot;Of all things it is true that two
and two make four.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is worth while to spend a little thought in getting at the root
reason why mathematics, because of its very abstractness, must always remain one
of the most important topics for thought.&nbsp; Let us try to make clear to
ourselves why explanations of the order of events necessarily tend to become
mathematical.&quot;&nbsp; p.3.</p>
<p>Observes the orderliness of nature, and interconnection.&nbsp; p.4.</p>
<p>&quot;The laws satisfied by the course of events in the world of external
things are to be described, if possible, in a neutral universal fashion, the
same for blind men as for deaf men, and the same for beings with faculties
beyond our ken as for normal human beings.&quot; p.5.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus it comes about that, step by step, and not realizing the full
meaning of the process, mankind has been led to search for a mathematical
description of the properties of the universe, because in this way only can a
general idea of the course of events be formed, freed from reference to
particular persons or to particular types of sensation.&quot; p.5</p>
  <p>Here it gets interesting.&nbsp; I would not say we are describing the
  universe, but the idea of having a theory that stands apart from our
  individual experience and yet is verifiable intersubjectively would certainly
  be appropriate.</p>
  <p>There seems to be a confusion with reduction, though, also on p.5.&nbsp;
  &quot;But in its final analysis, science seeks to describe an apple in terms
  of the positions and motions of molecules ... .&quot;&nbsp; I would say, if
  that is what science is seeking to do, it is remarkably unsuccessful.</p>
  <p>To ponder: &quot;This point has usually been misunderstood, from being
  thought of in too narrow a way.&nbsp; Pythagoras had a glimpse of it when he
  proclaimed that number was the source of all things.&nbsp; In modern times the
  belief that the ultimate explanation of all things was to be found in
  Newtonian mechanics was an adumbration of the truth that all science as it
  grows towards perfection becomes mathematical in its ideas.&quot; pp.5-6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="2">2</a>. Variables</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Mathematics as a science commenced when first someone, probably a
  Greek, proved propositions about <i>any</i> thing or about <i>some</i> things,
  without specification of definite particular things.&quot;&nbsp; p.7.</p>
  <p>Talks about the use of letters for free variables in algebra.</p>
  <p>Talks about the notion of infinity when &quot;we generalize and say that if
  <var>x</var> be any number there exists some number (or numbers) <var>y</var>
  such that <var>y</var> &gt; <var>x</var>.&quot;&nbsp; p.7.</p>
  <p>There is a tendency to see mathematics as offering descriptions and
  explanations.&nbsp; I would assert that mathematics provides neither.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="5">5</a>. The Symbolism of Mathematics</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;For our present purposes ... the history of the notation is a
  detail.&nbsp; The interesting point to notice is the admirable illustration
  which this numeral system affords of the enormous importance of a good
  notation.&nbsp; By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good
  notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems. ... &quot;
  p.39</p>
  <p>&quot;It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and
  by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the
  habit of thinking of what we are doing.&nbsp; The precise opposite is the
  case.&nbsp; Civilization advances by extending the number of important
  operations which we can perform without thinking about them.&nbsp; Operations
  of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle--they are strictly limited in
  number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive
  moments.&quot;&nbsp; pp.41-42&nbsp; -- Lovely!</p>
  <p>&quot;The symbolism of mathematics is in truth the outcome of the general
  ideas which dominate the science.&nbsp; We have now two such general ideas
  before us, that of the variable and that of algebraic form.&quot;&nbsp; p.47.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="6">6</a>. Generalizations of Number</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whitehead does the construction on the denumerability of the rationals on
  pp. 53-54.</p>
  <p>Have the index of <var>m</var>/<var>n</var> be <var>m</var>+<var>n</var>.&nbsp;
  Then proceed through the indices, starting with 2 (1/1) and enumerate all of
  the rationals having that index. There are always <var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1
  of them.&nbsp; Within an index, one can order the rationals, starting with 1/(<var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1),
  ..., <var>m</var>/<var>n</var>, ... (<var>m</var>+<var>n</var>-1)/1, ordering
  by numerator.</p>
  <p>He then discusses that Cantor showed the reals are not denumerable.</p>
  <p>Explores generality, for example, working with the integral domain rather
  than the non-negative natural numbers, even though we end up with negative
  results of subtractions, having no counter part in the world.&nbsp; This
  generalization is indispensible, and we have come not to question it.</p>
  <p>Whitehead has his particular finesse -- how to look at the operations of
  arithmetic -- to allow the generalization for the real field, for
  example.&nbsp; He describes the difficulties of not doing so:</p>
  <p>&quot;Here are difficulties become acute; for this form [<var>x</var>=<var>b</var>-<var>a</var>]
  can only be used for the numerical interpretation [of a quantity in the world]
  so long as <var>b</var> is greater than <var>a</var>, and we cannot say
  without qualification that <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> may be any
  constants.&nbsp; ... Really prolonged mathematical investigations would be
  impossible under such conditions. Every equation would at last be buried under
  a pile of limitations.&quot;&nbsp; pp.57-58.</p>
  <p>Whitehead proposes a different interpretation that has the signed numbers
  be operations for adding or taking away.&nbsp; Then x = -3 is fine, because it
  means it is the taking away of 3.</p>
  <p>We can do that or not.&nbsp; Here is how Whitehead leaves it:</p>
  <p>&quot;The idea of positive and negative numbers has been practically the
  most successful of mathematical subtleties.&quot;&nbsp; p.60.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After earlier acknowledging the power of introducing 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="11">11</a>. Functions</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Looks at continuity.&nbsp; Uses the notion of independent variable and the
  dependent one.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a name="17">17</a>. Quantity</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>At the end,</p>
  <p>&quot;As it is, physical science reposes on the main ideas of number,
  quantity, space, and time.&nbsp; The mathematical sciences associated with
  them do not form the whole of mathematics, but they are the substratum of
  mathematical physics as at present existing.&quot;&nbsp; p.186.</p>
