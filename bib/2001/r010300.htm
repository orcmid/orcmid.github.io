      <dd>Williams, Bernard Arthur Owen.&nbsp; <i>Plato</i>.&nbsp; The Invention
        of Philosophy.&nbsp; The Great Philosophers
        Series, no. 23.&nbsp; Phoenix, London; Rutledge, NY (London: 1997, New
        York: 1999).&nbsp; ISBN 0-415-92395-6 pbk.&nbsp; 57pp.<font size="-1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not so taken by this little book in the
        same way that I have been by the one on Bertrand Russell [<a href="../philosophy.htm#[Monk1999]">Monk1999</a>].&nbsp;
        My hesitation is about being found cheating, relying on what might be
        called the <i>Reader's Digest</i> take on the invention of
        philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is here I am confronted by myself as a snob
        as well as a dilettante.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of this little book is its use in
        sorting out the range of Plato's interests and discussions so that I can
        focus my readings and search on the elements that interest me: the
        development of idealism and the relationship of language, memory, and
        mathematics to our conception of the world.&nbsp; There is far more of
        importance in Plato's work, and they are not entirely separate.&nbsp; Williams'
        sketch provides a way to focus my own explorations and also remain aware
        of the greater reach of Plato's philosophical embrace.&nbsp; dh:

<p align="left">
        Plato lived from 427 to 347 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span>.&nbsp;
        He essentially invented philosophy.
        </p>


  <p align="left">
        His works are the first to come down to us essentially complete.&nbsp;
  And he looked at all of the areas that have been questioned in philosophical
  inquery before and since.&nbsp; Williams remarks that Plato did not have the
  modern sense of history and its impact (something we may be losing), yet he
  and the Greeks dwelled in questions that remain to this day and engage us in
  reconciling our place in the world and our relationship to each other.
        </p>


  <p align="left">It is important to avoid assuming that Plato is telling us
  what to believe.&nbsp; He will often refute a position, or entertain a
  question, but one should not presume that Plato professes a resolution.&nbsp;
  Plato may not have taken any of his ideas seriously, and we should be careful
  not to assume more than that ourselves.
        </p>


  <p align="left">I am interested primarily in what we refer to as Platonic
  idealism and the topics that impinge on it.&nbsp; Those are the ones I am
  cataloging here, using what Williams offers as an initial structure.

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">It is in the dialogs of the Middle Period that Plato considers
        </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The everyday physical world of appearance</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">A realm of intellectual, eternal objects</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Forms as the objects of real knowledge</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Forms directly attainable by the immortal soul</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">Greek word <i>logos</i> has roots in both speech and
  reason.&nbsp; &quot;One of Plato's ongoing undertakings was to construct
  models of what it is for an utterance to not jsut tell a story but to give a
  reason. [p.12]&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">What must be given to answer a question about what a concept
  (i.e., virtue) is.&nbsp; Not a list of examples, &quot;because that will not
  show what the examples have in common. p.14]&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">It can't merely be a characteristic that necessarily goes with
  something, because it doesn't explain what the characteristic is.&nbsp; (e.g.,
  shape).</p>
  <p align="left">An account must be explanatory, giving us an insight into what
  the described thing is.&nbsp; [This raises an interesting question with regard
  to the explanation of algorithms, for example. dh:2001-03-10]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">The idea that when we recognize something that we didn't know
  before, we must be remembering, and this is because there is an immortal soul
  that has the knowledge of learning in earlier lives.&nbsp; This is the
  supposition of <i>a priori </i>knowledge, not of facts, but of something
  amenable to reason. [p.17]</p>
  <p align="left">We get to the discussion of the apparent innateness of <i>a
  priori</i> knowledge.&nbsp; (Independent of arguments about the soul and its
  immortality.)</p>
  <p align="left">The idea that the naked soul once came to see mathematical
  objects directly by the &quot;eye of the intellect.&quot;&nbsp; Creates an odd
  contradiction in Plato's view, to rely on an experience of the soul when he is
  distrustful of experience.</p>
  <p align="left">True belief does not enable you to teach another to get
  somewhere by themselves.&nbsp; &quot;But if we could find the right chain of
  reasoning to tie those beliefs down, so they do not run away, then they might
  become knowledge, and then they could be taught.&nbsp; Philosophy will provide
  those chains of reasoning and this it how it will change our lives.
  [p.19]&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Plato sees that it is not true that the truths of mathematics
  are not literally true of any physical diagram or thing.&nbsp; And that
  mathematics relies on unproven axioms.</p>
  <p align="left">Plato proposes a program of deriving all mathematical truths
  from &quot;some higher or more general truths, arriving ultimately at an
  entirely rational and perspicuous structure which in some sense depends on the
  self-explanatory starting point of the Good. [p.31]&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Forms are the objects which are eternal, immaterial,
  unchanging, and the objects of rational, <i>a priori</i>, knowledge.&nbsp;
  Plato thinks there are abstract objects of rational understanding, existing
  independently of the material world.&nbsp; He does not see our understanding
  of them as contributing to the resolution of all questions, at least not at
  the end.</p>
  <p align="left">Plato would see courage as existing even if there were no
  courageous people.&nbsp; Plato also wants to say that particulars cannot
  properly, perfectly, or without qualification, instantiate Forms.</p>
  <p align="left">Geometers use material, particularly diagrams, but they cannot
  be talking directly about those diagrams, or what they say would simply be
  untrue.&nbsp; They must be talking about something else.&nbsp; Triangles
  formed of absolutely straight lines with no breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">A Form is a paradigm.&nbsp; It is a model and it is never
  achieved in artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is, Plato considers, something that
  the artisan has in mind as the model to which the crafstman aspires.</p>
  <p align="left">These things - triangles, courage, and dampness - are all
  uncreated and unchanging.&nbsp; The world changes, the Forms do not.</p>
  <p align="left" style="border-style: double">I struck the wrong key and failed
  to save all the changes made after this point.&nbsp; They continue from the
  bottom of [p.33].&nbsp; I am so distressed that I did that, I am not going to
  go back and attempt to repeat my notes.&nbsp; I must return the book to the
  library today, and I am off to do that.&nbsp; dh:2001-03-11</p>
