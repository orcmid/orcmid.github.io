<blockquote>


<p align="left">
        The idea of biological determinism.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xvii: Beginning slowly in the 1950s, at the peak of the 
	prestige and success of the physical sciences, physicists and chemists began 
	to migrate into biology, becoming the founders of modern molecular biology.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xviii: The change from science as physics to science as 
	biology is not merely a redirection of academic lives.&nbsp; It reflects our 
	general view of what we want to know about the world.&nbsp; ... We really 
	want to know is why some people are rich and some poor, some sick and some 
	well, why a woman can&#39;t be more like a man, and why I can&#39;t live to be a 
	sexually active centenarian.&nbsp; In consciousness, as in science, the 
	animate has come to dominate the inanimate and, in particular it is now 
	widely believed that the main question of scientific investigation ought to 
	be not what constitutes matter but what it is to be human.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xx: The ambitious program of the nineteenth century, to make 
	biological phenomena simply the extension of the physical world, has been a 
	remarkable success in the twentieth.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxi: Two major domains remain to be satisfactorily included 
	within the mechanistic program.&nbsp; One [is] ... the problem of the 
	development of form.&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal is known about the genes that 
	encode various signals in development ..., but we do not have the faintest 
	idea about how all of this is turned into the shape of my nose.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxi: The other field of immense ignorance and conceptual 
	poverty is the problem of understanding the central nervous system.&nbsp; 
	What is the mapping between the physical states and connections of brain 
	cells and mental states?&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxii: The success of the program of physicalizing biology 
	has encourage the program, also inherited from the nineteenth century, of 
	biologizing the psychic and the social. ... It is easy to think that if 
	organisms are largely the consequences of genes that they have inherited, 
	then the similarities and differences of organisms are the consequences of 
	similarities and differences in their genes.&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxiv: The strain of simplistic scientism that characterized 
	social theory from the beginning of the nineteenth century continues to 
	infect it today.
        </p>

<h1 align="left"><a name="s1">1</a>.&nbsp; Measuring What We Already See
        </h1>


<blockquote>
  <p align="left">&quot;The Inferiority Complex,&quot; Chapter 1 in <i>
	<a href="#Lewontin2000">It Ain&#39;t Necessarily So</a></i>, was published on 
	October 22, 1981 as a review of
        </p>


  <p align="left">Gould, Steven Jay.&nbsp; <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>.&nbsp; 
	(Norton: 1981).<br>
        </p>


  <p align="left">The exchange with Terry Tomkow and Robert M. Martin was 
	published on February 4, 1982.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.4: The ideology of biological determinism.&nbsp; According 
	to this view, the patent differences between individuals, sexes, ethnic 
	groups, and races in status, wealth, and power are based on innate 
	biological differences in temperament and ability which are passed from 
	parent to offspring at conception.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.12: The notion of heritability of IQ differences is 
	scientifically unsupported.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.13: The <i>Mismeasure of Man</i> looks beyond the politics, 
	the data, and the frauds to address the central epistomological issue about 
	intelligence: &quot;Is there anything to be measured?&quot;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.14: The tests are laden with cultural and value assumptions, 
	and the circumstances of testing are laden with questions.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.14: The claim is made by their supporters that IQ tests 
	measure a single underlying innate thing, general intelligence.&nbsp; ... 
	the ability to learn, a fixed feature immanent to different degrees in every 
	fertilized egg.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.15: The agreement of the results of various parts of the 
	same tests have been built into them.&nbsp; In order for the original 
	Stanford-Binet test to have won credibility as an intelligence test, it 
	necessarily had to order children in conformity with the a priori judgment 
	of psychologists and teachers about what they thought indicated 
	intelligence.&nbsp; During the construction of the tests, questions that 
	were poorly correlated with others were dropped, since they clearly did not 
	measure &quot;intelligence,&quot; until a maximally consistent set was found.&nbsp; 
	The claim that something real is then measured by these selected questions 
	is a classic case of reification.&nbsp; It is rather like claiming, as a 
	proof of the existence of God, that he is mentioned in all the books of the 
	Bible.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.16: Gould&#39;s view of the biological determinists is that they 
	are doubly blinded: first by their own racial and ethnic prejudices, and 
	second by what Gould calls &quot;Burt&#39;s real error,&quot; the vulgar reductionism that 
	leads them to reify an abstract statistical entity.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.17: [Lewontin wants to go farther.]&nbsp; Biological 
	determinism is the conjunction of political necessity with an ideologically 
	formed view of nature. ... The problem ... is to reconcile the ideology of 
	equality with the manifest inequality of status, wealth, and power.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.19: Biological determinism, both in its literary and 
	scientific forms, is part of the legitimating ideology of our society, the 
	solution offered to our deepest social mystery, the analgesic for our most 
	recurrent social pain.&nbsp; In the words of Charles Darwin, quoted on the 
	title page of <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, &quot;If the misery of our poor be 
	caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our 
	sin.&quot;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.22: Tomkow and Martin assert, intelligence is (if anything) 
	a property of things (people).
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.30: Lewontin remarks, the height of a person is a natural 
	attribute of a real object.&nbsp; The average of the heights of a group of 
	people is not an attribute of any real object. ... It is a mental construct.&nbsp; 
	Lewontin extends this idea to factors.&nbsp; That does not make the 
	calculated result for an individual a natural attribute or the measure of 
	one.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.32: It is not simply our &quot;judgments of intelligence&quot; but the 
	very idea of intelligence that is a historically contingent mental 
	construct.
        </p>


  <p align="left">pp.32-33: It is important to point out that the distinction 
	between mental constructs and natural attributes is more than a 
	philosophical quibble, even when those constructs are based on physical 
	measurements.&nbsp; Averages are not inherited; they are not subject to 
	natural selection; they are not physical causes of any events.&nbsp; There 
	are no &quot;genes for handsomeness&quot; or &quot;genes for intelligence&quot; any more than 
	there are &quot;genes for saintliness.&quot;&nbsp; To assert that there are such genes 
	is a conceptual, not a factual, error and one that has major consequences 
	for scientific practice and social analysis.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.40: In the end, despite all the effort to make the study of 
	social structures &quot;objective,&quot; we always bring to the study of society an 
	already formed social theory.
        </p>

	The Case Against Creationism.&nbsp; p.46: Also defends Darwinism against the

	Ernst Mayr.&nbsp; p.46: Sees subversives within the very citadel, conspiring 
	to destroy what the barbarian hordes are unable to shake.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.44: There have been only two real revolutions in biology 
	since the Rennaissance.&nbsp; The first was the introduction of mechanical 
	biology by William Harvey and René Descartes.&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.45: The second biological revolution, to which we attach the 
	name of Darwin, is still being consolidated.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.48: &quot;There is no disagreement in science about whether 
evolution has occured.&nbsp; There is bloody warfare on the question of how it 
has occured.&quot;
        </p>


<p align="left">p.53:&quot;There are two basic dynamic forms for evolving systems.&nbsp; 
One is <i>transformational</i>, in which the collection of objects evolves 
because every individual element in the collection undergoes a similar 
transformation.&nbsp; ... Most physical systems and social institutions evolve 
transformationally.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.54: &quot;The alternative evolutionary dynamic, unique as far as we 
know to the organic world, and uniquelly understood by Darwin, is <i>variational</i>
evolution.&nbsp; In a variational scheme, there is variation of properties among 
individuals in the ensemble, variations that arise from causes independent of 
any effect it may have on the individual who possesses it.&nbsp; That is, the 
variation arises at random with respect to its effect.&nbsp; The collection of 
individuals evolves by a sorting process in which some variant types persist and 
reproduce, while others die out.&nbsp; Variational evolution occurs by the 
change of frequency of different variants, rather than by a set of developmental 
transformations of every individual.&quot;
        </p>


<p align="left">p.55: Darwin&#39;s problem, and that of anyone trying to produce a 
theory of evolution, was to explain two apparently distinct features of the 
organic world, <i>diversity</i> and <i>fit</i>.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.56: Darwin claimed that it was the sorting process among 
variants that produced the fit of organisms to the environment.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.67: Before Darwin, the central issue for science sas to 
discover the Platonic form that lay behind the imperfect reality ... Variations 
among organisms was thought to be ontologically distinct from the causes of 
their similarity, a smiliarity that we glimpse but dimly.&nbsp; If only we could 
eliminate the noisy confusion of the material objects themselves, the true 
relation could be seen.&nbsp; Darwin revolutionized our study of nature by 
taking the actual variation among actual things as central to the reality, not 
as an annoying and irrelevant disturbance to be wished away.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.68: &quot;Geneticists, who are supposed to know better, will 
sometimes talk about a gene&#39;s determining a particular shape, size, or behavior 
instead of reminding themselves that if genes determine anything, it is the 
pattern of variation of a developing organism in responses to variation in the 
environment.
        </p>


<p align="left">&quot;This error of geneticists is particulary ironic, because it was 
Gregor Mendel who, unknown to the rest of the scientific world, had, 
contemporaneously with Darwin, solved the other leading problem of biology by 
making variations his object of study.&nbsp; Mendel solved the problem of why 
offspring look like their parents by studying the patterns of differences 
between them.&nbsp; He discovered, as Darwin had, that similarity and variation 
are inextricably intertwined aspects of the same reality.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.72: &quot;I have come to realize, however, that Darwin&#39;s 
variational theory, as revolutionary as it was, depended upon a prior and more 
radical epistemological break with the past.&nbsp; Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution 
was that variations among organisms arose from causes that were internal to the 
organism and whose nature was independent of the demands of the external world.&nbsp; 
That is what is meant when we say that mutations are &#39;random.&#39; ... All sorts of 
mutations occur and it is only those that, by chance, enable to organism to 
survive better that will spread throughout the species.&nbsp; So the internal 
forces that give rise to variation are causally independent of the external 
forces that select them.&nbsp; The internal and the external, what we now think 
of as the gene and the environment, meet in the organism.&nbsp; This alienation 
of internal from external forces, of inside from outside, with the organism as 
their nexus, is fundamental to the Darwinian view.
