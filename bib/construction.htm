<h1>Change History </h1>

<dl>
  <dt><b>2023-08-31T19:23Z bib/ Consolidation of Orcmid&#39;s Lair readings/ and 
	Miser Project readings/ </b></dt>
	<dd>The two change histories have been combined and lightly edited for 
	historical/archival purposes.&nbsp; The (merged) Diary &amp; Job Jar is now the 
	continuation for the consolidation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><b>2014-04-30-17:03 Subsequent Change History is carried in the Diary &amp; 
	Job Jar, <a href="c000000.htm">c000000.htm</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></dt>
	<dt><b>2003-08-01-10:48 Establish Construction Zone (Orcmid&#39;s Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>The steady migration of pages to a consistent HTML 4.01 style, with
    reliance on inclusion of standard elements for the construction shack, is
    formalized here.&nbsp; The annotated-bibliography pages are being restyled
    as they are touched as part of normal updating.&nbsp; The construction
    structure is now updated to reflect that activity.&nbsp; Further
    construction zone activity and change history is now recorded in the 
	<b><a href="c000000.htm">construction
    job jar</a></b> for this section of the site.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	</dd>
	<dt><b>2002-07-11-15:44 Replace <code>ProgSys.htm</code> by <code>FunProg.htm</code> 
	(Miser Project)</b></dt>
	<dd>I do not need a general programming systems and language bibliography 
	here, and the one actually compiled is mostly about functional programming.&nbsp; 
	I made the necessary adjustments here to switch to Functional Programming.&nbsp; 
	It would be useful to have Programming Systems separate from Software Tools 
	along with the Computer Science material, and I will make a reincarnation of 
	Programming Systems in Orcmid&#39;s Readings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
	<dt><b>2002-03-17-12:22 Clean up for Separate Mirror (Miser Project)</b></dt>
	<dd>Separation of <b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b> from <b><code>orcmid.com</code></b>
    requires careful correction of links to the bibliographies in Orcmid&#39;s Lair 
	<b><code>/readings</code></b>.&nbsp; The process is complete when the same is true 
	for incoming links from the master bibliography list.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>1. The construction history and default page are set up for the 
	<b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b> mirroring.<br>2. The <b><code>progsys.htm</code></b> and 
	<b><code>theory.htm</code></b> 
	are also upgraded, with attention to cross-references. Some corrections to 
	shortcuts are made just for neatness.<br>3.&nbsp;The Readings files that are kept here, near the bibliography entries that 
	refer to them, are updated to be part of an independent <b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b>
    mirror.<br>4. The Orcmid Reading Notes log is updated to refer to the notes here via 
	the <b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b> mirror.<br>5. The Orcmid Readings Master Bibliography (<b><code>authors.htm</code></b>) 
	is updated to refer to the bibliography sections here via the <b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b>
    mirror.<br>6. Both Orcmid&#39;s Lair and The Miser Project are updated on infonuovo.com to 
	prepare for migration of The Miser Project next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><b>2001-11-29-12:33 Complete Mirror Grouping (Orcmid&#39;s Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>The top structure of Orcmid's Lair is set up so that there is no
    dependency on anything global to the <b><code>/orcmid</code></b>
    sub-web.&nbsp; The only peer dependency is into the <b><code>/miser</code></b>
    sub-web. [2002-03-28: Even that dependency is being removed in favor of <b>
	<code>http://miser-theory.info/</code></b>]<br>1. The images in the title bars of construction-structure pages are located
    in the <b><code>/orcmid/images</code></b> folder.<br>2. All internal and lateral (miser) references are relative references.<br>3. Hard links in these pages are being replaced by relative links that do
    not depend upon their being a known anchor site for location of this
    material.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
	<dt><b>2001-11-26-14:32 Begin to Prepare Mirror Grouping (Orcmid&#39;s Lair) </b>
	</dt>
	<dd>Orcmid's Lair and the Miser Project are interdependent sections that are
    capable of being mirrored independently of other groups (such as those for
    DMware).&nbsp; The relativization of links
    and the use of global indexes for linking outside of the relative group is
    being introduced here as it is for DMware.<br>&nbsp; 1. I am revising the construction structure first, so that relative
    links work up the tree, and links to the builders of Orcmid's Lair are to an
    author page in the ultimate (orcmid-level) construction section.<br>&nbsp; 2. Eventually, the entire group is relative to Orcmid's Lair and the
    image and construction sections there are the top ones used, with anything
    else determined from <a href="../construction/"><b><code>construction</code></b></a>.</dd>
	<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
	<dt><b>2001-05-10-14:14 Use simplified location-identification (Orcmid&#39;s 
	Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>Since I am working here today, I began cleaning up the construction
    structure to use the simplified &quot;location&quot; identification begun
    with the <b><code>orcmid</code></b> top-level construction-structure
    pages.</dd>
	<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
	<dt><b>2001-04-08-17:24 Introduce NuovoDoc Centrale identification (Orcmid&#39;s 
	Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>The images and links are changed to reflect the new NuovoDoc Centrale
    nomenclature and branding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Amended 2001-11-29</b>: The NuovoDoc
    identification and the Centrale identification is submerged so that there is
    no limitation on the choice of anchor site.&nbsp; Although a NuovoDoc image
    is being used for the initial OrcmidsLair-logo image, that will be remedied
    simply by replacing the image later.&nbsp; All links to the image are
    already correct.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><b>2000-09-08-12:27 Add Being Coverage (Orcmid&#39;s Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>I added a &quot;Being&quot; bibliography and also continued the
    cleaning-up that originated on the Miser Project.&nbsp; The notes on
    readings are now part of a consistent <b><code>R<i>yymmnn</i>.htm</code></b>
    series of web pages, and there will be a single catalog for the entire
    Orcmid's Lair group.</dd>
	<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
	<dt><b>2000-09-06-12:27 Introduce R-numbered notes for readings (Orcmid&#39;s 
	Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>I introduce R-numbered notes in place of the randomly-named ones, and 
	begin to provide more organization, inspired by my experience supporting 
	ODMA.</dd>
	<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
	<dt><b>2000-07-18-21:53 Expand Some More (Orcmid&#39;s Lair)</b></dt>
	<dd>I want to include some standard software and programming language books
    for convenient reference from around the site.&nbsp; I am going to include
    them in <a href="../bib/softools.htm">software tools</a>, because I can't figure out where else they go.</dd>
	<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><b>2000-07-18-19:06 Add default page and connect up the readings to 
	readings elsewhere (Miser Project)</b></dt>
	<dd>I added a default page here too, provided a link to the two bibliographies 
	and to bibliographies elsewhere on this site (now in 
	Orcmid&#39;s Lair).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><b>2000-07-18-18:27 Expand Readings (orcmid)</b></dt>
	<dd>I took apart a working bibliography for The Miser
    Project, and a few items
    made their way back here.<br>1. I started a <a href="../bib/sysarch.htm">System Architecture and Design</a>
    readings page and a <a href="../bib/compsci.htm">Computer Science</a> readings
    page.<br>2. I am ending up with a bibliography that is divided up in arbitrary
    categories and also distributed among projects on <b><code>infonuovo.com</code></b>.&nbsp; I may
    not like how this goes, but it is what I am doing for now.<br>3. I finally created a default page, and used it to list the
    &quot;readings&quot; that there are so far.<br>4. I tidied up the quality page and made all of the pages uniform.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>2000-07-18-14:17 Create Miser Project /reading Project &amp; 
	Construction Log (Miser Project)</strong></dt>
	<dd>A bibliography, since generalized to Orcmid&#39;s Lair, is created here for 
	cataloging bibliographic entries for computation-theory materials.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
	<dt><strong>2000-07-18-14:17 Create orcmid/reading Project &amp; Construction Log 
	(Orcmid&#39;s Lairy)</strong></dt>
	<dd>1. The orcmid reading project is created to provide a place for notes,
    bibliographies, and reviews of material that I find valuable in the work of
    InfoNuovo and the projects carried on infonuovo.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
	<dd>2. I established an index.htm and this construction.log to provide the
    initial construction structure.<br>3. The initial content consists of two bibliographies.&nbsp; One on
    materials addressing quality processes, another on the general computing
    milieu.&nbsp; These bibliographies are also intended to support more
    specialized references and notes in individual projects, such as The
    Miser Project.<br>4. This collection continues the idea of using random Web-page names for
    material that is not intended to be cross-referenced and which may be of an
    ephemeral character (such as <a href="2000/r000701.htm">BXn9rCKW.htm</a> was
    originally).&nbsp;
    It also means that agents (robots) and trollers can't find these pages by guessing
    their names.&nbsp; It is necessary to know the link.&nbsp; At some point, I
    may drive myself crazy with this stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
