<p align="left">
        The idea of biological determinism.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xvii: Beginning slowly in the 1950s, at the peak of the
  prestige and success of the physical sciences, physicists and chemists began
  to migrate into biology, becoming the founders of modern molecular biology.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xviii: The change from science as physics to science as
  biology is not merely a redirection of academic lives.&nbsp; It reflects our
  general view of what we want to know about the world.&nbsp; ... We really want
  to know is why some people are rich and some poor, some sick and some well,
  why a woman can't be more like a man, and why I can't live to be a sexually
  active centenarian.&nbsp; In consciousness, as in science, the animate has
  come to dominate the inanimate and, in particular it is now widely believed
  that the main question of scientific investigation ought to be not what
  constitutes matter but what it is to be human.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xx: The ambitious program of the nineteenth century, to make
  biological phenomena simply the extension of the physical world, has been a
  remarkable success in the twentieth.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxi: Two major domains remain to be satisfactorily included
  within the mechanistic program.&nbsp; One [is] ... the problem of the
  development of form.&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal is known about the genes that
  encode various signals in development ..., but we do not have the faintest
  idea about how all of this is turned into the shape of my nose.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxi: The other field of immense ignorance and conceptual
  poverty is the problem of understanding the central nervous system.&nbsp; What
  is the mapping between the physical states and connections of brain cells and
  mental states?&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxii: The success of the program of physicalizing biology
  has encourage the program, also inherited from the nineteenth century, of
  biologizing the psychic and the social. ... It is easy to think that if
  organisms are largely the consequences of genes that they have inherited, then
  the similarities and differences of organisms are the consequences of
  similarities and differences in their genes.&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.xxiv: The strain of simplistic scientism that characterized
  social theory from the beginning of the nineteenth century continues to infect
  it today.
        </p>

        </h1>


<blockquote>
  <p align="left">&quot;The Inferiority Complex,&quot; Chapter 1 in <i><a href="#[Lewontin2000]">It
  Ain't Necessarily So</a></i>, was published on October 22, 1981 as a review of
        </p>


  <p align="left">Gould, Steven Jay.&nbsp; <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>.&nbsp;
  (Norton: 1981).<br>
        </p>


  <p align="left">The exchange with Terry Tomkow and Robert M. Martin was
  published on February 4, 1982.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.4: The ideology of biological determinism.&nbsp; According
  to this view, the patent differences between individuals, sexes, ethnic
  groups, and races in status, wealth, and power are based on innate biological
  differences in temperament and ability which are passed from parent to
  offspring at conception.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.12: The notion of heritability of IQ differences is
  scientifically unsupported.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.13: The <i>Mismeasure of Man</i> looks beyond the politics,
  the data, and the frauds to address the central epistomological issue about
  intelligence: &quot;Is there anything to be measured?&quot;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.14: The tests are laden with cultural and value assumptions,
  and the circumstances of testing are laden with questions.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.14: The claim is made by their supporters that IQ tests
  measure a single underlying innate thing, general intelligence.&nbsp; ... the
  ability to learn, a fixed feature immanent to different degrees in every
  fertilized egg.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.15: The agreement of the results of various parts of the
  same tests have been built into them.&nbsp; In order for the original
  Stanford-Binet test to have won credibility as an intelligence test, it
  necessarily had to order children in conformity with the a priori judgment of
  psychologists and teachers about what they thought indicated
  intelligence.&nbsp; During the construction of the tests, questions that were
  poorly correlated with others were dropped, since they clearly did not measure
  &quot;intelligence,&quot; until a maximally consistent set was found.&nbsp;
  The claim that something real is then measured by these selected questions is
  a classic case of reification.&nbsp; It is rather like claiming, as a proof of
  the existence of God, that he is mentioned in all the books of the Bible.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.16: Gould's view of the biological determinists is that they
  are doubly blinded: first by their own racial and ethnic prejudices, and
  second by what Gould calls &quot;Burt's real error,&quot; the vulgar
  reductionism that leads them to reify an abstract statistical entity.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.17: [Lewontin wants to go farther.]&nbsp; Biological
  determinism is the conjunction of political necessity with an ideologically
  formed view of nature. ... The problem ... is to reconcile the ideology of
  equality with the manifest inequality of status, wealth, and power.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.19: Biological determinism, both in its literary and
  scientific forms, is part of the legitimating ideology of our society, the
  solution offered to our deepest social mystery, the analgesic for our most
  recurrent social pain.&nbsp; In the words of Charles Darwin, quoted on the
  title page of <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, &quot;If the misery of our poor be
  caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our
  sin.&quot;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.22: Tomkow and Martin assert, intelligence is (if anything)
  a property of things (people).
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.30: Lewontin remarks, the height of a person is a natural
  attribute of a real object.&nbsp; The average of the heights of a group of
  people is not an attribute of any real object. ... It is a mental
  construct.&nbsp; Lewontin extends this idea to factors.&nbsp; That does not
  make the calculated result for an individual a natural attribute or the
  measure of one.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.32: It is not simply our &quot;judgments of
  intelligence&quot; but the very idea of intelligence that is a historically
  contingent mental construct.
        </p>


  <p align="left">pp.32-33: It is important to point out that the distinction
  between mental constructs and natural attributes is more than a philosophical
  quibble, even when those constructs are based on physical measurements.&nbsp;
  Averages are not inherited; they are not subject to natural selection; they
  are not physical causes of any events.&nbsp; There are no &quot;genes for
  handsomeness&quot; or &quot;genes for intelligence&quot; any more than there
  are &quot;genes for saintliness.&quot;&nbsp; To assert that there are such
  genes is a conceptual, not a factual, error and one that has major
  consequences for scientific practice and social analysis.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.40: In the end, despite all the effort to make the study of
  social structures &quot;objective,&quot; we always bring to the study of
  society an already formed social theory.
        </p>

        </h1>

<p align="left">&nbsp;The Chapter on &quot;Darwin's Revolution&quot; was first
published on June 16, 1983, as a review of
        </p>


<p align="left">Miller, Jonathan., Van Loon, Borin.&nbsp; Darwin for
Beginners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pantheon (1982).&nbsp; p.46: Meant to introduce the

        </p>


  <p align="left">Smith, John Maynard (ed).&nbsp; Evolution Now: A Century After
  Darwin.&nbsp; W. H. Freeman (1982).&nbsp; p.46: Meant to expose for a
  professional audience the internal state and modern problems of the theory
  itself.
        </p>


  <p align="left">Gale, Barry G.&nbsp; Evolution Without Evidence: Charles
  Darwin and &quot;The Origin of Species.&quot;&nbsp; University of New Mexico
  Press (1982).
        </p>


  <p align="left">Gribbin, John., Cherfas, Jeremy.&nbsp; The Monkey Puzzle:
  Reshaping the Evolutionary Tree.&nbsp; Pantheon (1982).&nbsp; p.46: Concerned
  with the quest for that mythic pot of paleontological gold, the Missing Link.

  <p align="left">Eldridge, Niles., Tattersall, Ian.&nbsp; The Myths of Human
  Evolution.&nbsp; Columbia University Press (1982).&nbsp; p.46: Likewise
  concerned with the quest for the Missing Link.
        </p>


  <p align="left">Futuyma, Douglas J.&nbsp; Science on Trial: The Case for
  Evolution.&nbsp; Pantheon (1983).&nbsp; p.46: Immediately relevant work that
  defends Darwinism against the real besiegers.
        </p>


  <p align="left">Kitcher, Philip., Kitcher, Patricia.&nbsp; Abusing Science:
  The Case Against Creationism.&nbsp; p.46: Also defends Darwinism against the
  real besiegers.
        </p>


  <p align="left">Ruse, Michael.&nbsp; Darwinism Defended: A Guide to the
  Evolution Controversies.&nbsp; Addison-Wesley (1982).&nbsp; Forword by Ernst
  Mayr.&nbsp; p.46: Sees subversives within the very citadel, conspiring to
  destroy what the barbarian hordes are unable to shake.
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.44: There have been only two real revolutions in biology
  since the Rennaissance.&nbsp; The first was the introduction of mechanical
  biology by William Harvey and René Descartes.&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">p.45: The second biological revolution, to which we attach the
  name of Darwin, is still being consolidated.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.48: &quot;There is no disagreement in science about whether
evolution has occured.&nbsp; There is bloody warfare on the question of how it
has occured.&quot;
        </p>


<p align="left">p.53:&quot;There are two basic dynamic forms for evolving
systems.&nbsp; One is <i>transformational</i>, in which the collection of
objects evolves because every individual element in the collection undergoes a
similar transformation.&nbsp; ... Most physical systems and social institutions
evolve transformationally.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.54: &quot;The alternative evolutionary dynamic, unique as far
as we know to the organic world, and uniquelly understood by Darwin, is <i>variational</i>
evolution.&nbsp; In a variational scheme, there is variation of properties among
individuals in the ensemble, variations that arise from causes independent of
any effect it may have on the individual who possesses it.&nbsp; That is, the
variation arises at random with respect to its effect.&nbsp; The collection of
individuals evolves by a sorting process in which some variant types persist and
reproduce, while others die out.&nbsp; Variational evolution occurs by the
change of frequency of different variants, rather than by a set of developmental
transformations of every individual.&quot;
        </p>


<p align="left">p.55: Darwin's problem, and that of anyone trying to produce a
theory of evolution, was to explain two apparently distinct features of the
organic world, <i>diversity</i> and <i>fit</i>.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.56: Darwin claimed that it was the sorting process among
variants that produced the fit of organisms to the environment.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.67: Before Darwin, the central issue for science sas to
discover the Platonic form that lay behind the imperfect reality ... Variations
among organisms was thought to be ontologically distinct from the causes of
their similarity, a smiliarity that we glimpse but dimly.&nbsp; If only we could
eliminate the noisy confusion of the material objects themselves, the true
relation coould be seen.&nbsp; Darwin revolutionized our study of nature by
taking the actual variation among actual things as central to the reality, not
as an annoying and irrelevant disturbance to be wished away.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.68: &quot;Geneticists, who are supposed to know better, will
sometimes talk about a gene's determining a particular shape, size, or behavior
instead of reminding themselves that if genes determine anything, it is the
pattern of variation of a developing organism in responses to variation in the
environment.
        </p>


<p align="left">&quot;This error of geneticists is particulary ironic, because
it was Gregor Mendel who, unknown to the rest of the scientific world, had,
contemporaneously with Darwin, solved the other leading problem of biology by
making variations his object of study.&nbsp; Mendel solved the problem of why
offspring look like their parents by studying the patterns of differences
between them.&nbsp; He discovered, as Darwin had, that similarity and variation
are inextricably intertwined aspects of the same reality.
        </p>


<p align="left">p.72: &quot;I have come to realize, however, that Darwin's
variational theory, as revolutionary as it was, depended upon a prior and more
radical epistemological break with the past.&nbsp; Darwin's theory of evolution
was that variations among organisms arose from causes that were internal to the
organism and whose nature was independent of the demands of the external
world.&nbsp; That is what is meant when we say that mutations are 'random.' ...
All sorts of mutations occur and it is only those that, by chance, enable to
organism to survive better that will spread throughout the species.&nbsp; So the
internal forces that give rise to variation are causally independent of the
external forces that select them.&nbsp; The internal and the external, what we
now think of as the gene and the environment, meet in the organism.&nbsp; This
alienation of internal from external forces, of inside from outside, with the
organism as their nexus, is fundamental to the Darwinian view.
