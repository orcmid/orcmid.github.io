<dl>
  <dt><b>2003-08-01-10:48 Establish Construction Zone (<a href="../construction/orcmid.htm">orcmid</a>)</b></dt>
  <dd>The steady migration of pages to a consistent HTML 4.01 style, with
    reliance on inclusion of standard elements for the construction shack, is
    formalized here.&nbsp; The annotated-bibliography pages are being restyled
    as they are touched as part of normal updating.&nbsp; The construction
    structure is now updated to reflect that activity.&nbsp; Further
    construction zone activity and change history is now recorded in the <a href="c000000.htm"><b>construction
    job jar</b></a> for this section of the site.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b>2001-11-29-12:33 Complete Mirror Grouping (<a href="../construction/orcmid.htm">orcmid</a>)</b></dt>
  <dd>The top structure of Orcmid's Lair is set up so that there is no
    dependency on anything global to the <b><code>/orcmid</code></b>
    sub-web.&nbsp; The only peer dependency is into the <b><code>/miser</code></b>
    sub-web. [2002-03-28: Even that dependency is being removed in favor of <b><code>http://miser-theory.info/</code></b>]<br>
    1. The images in the title bars of construction-structure pages are located
    in the <b><code>/orcmid/images</code></b> folder.<br>
    2. All internal and lateral (miser) references are relative references.<br>
    3. Hard links in these pages are being replaced by relative links that do
    not depend upon their being a known anchor site for location of this
    material.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
</small>

<small>
  <dt><b>2001-11-26-14:32 Begin to Prepare Mirror Grouping</b></dt>
  <dd>Orcmid's Lair and the Miser Project are interdependent sections that are
    capable of being mirrored independently of other groups (such as those for
    DMware).&nbsp; The relativization of links
    and the use of global indexes for linking outside of the relative group is
    being introduced here as it is for DMware.<br>
    &nbsp; 1. I am revising the construction structure first, so that relative
    links work up the tree, and links to the builders of Orcmid's Lair are to an
    author page in the ultimate (orcmid-level) construction section.<br>
    &nbsp; 2. Eventually, the entire group is relative to Orcmid's Lair and the
    image and construction sections there are the top ones used, with anything
    else determined from <a href="../construction/"><b><code>orcmid/construction</code></b></a>.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>2001-05-10-14:14 Use simplified location-identification (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>Since I am working here today, I began cleaning up the construction
    structure to use the simplified &quot;location&quot; identification begun
    with the <a href="../"><b><code>orcmid</code></b></a> top-level <a href="../index.htm">construction-structure
    pages</a>.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b>2001-04-08-17:24 Introduce NuovoDoc Centrale identification (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>The images and links are changed to reflect the new NuovoDoc Centrale
    nomenclature and branding.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Amended 2001-11-29</b>: The NuovoDoc
    identification and the Centrale identification is submerged so that there is
    no limitation on the choice of anchor site.&nbsp; Although a NuovoDoc image
    is being used for the initial OrcmidsLair-logo image, that will be remedied
    simply by replacing the image later.&nbsp; All links to the image are
    already correct.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>2000-09-08-12:27 Add Being Coverage (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I added a &quot;Being&quot; bibliography and also continued the
    cleaning-up that originated on the Miser Project.&nbsp; The notes on
    readings are now part of a consistent <b><code>R<i>yymmnn</i>.htm</code></b>
    series of web pages, and there will be a single catalog for the entire
    Orcmid's Lair group.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>2000-07-18-21:53 Expand Some More (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I want to include some standard software and programming language books
    for convenient reference from around the site.&nbsp; I am going to include
    them in <a href="softools.htm"> software tools</a>, because I can't figure out where else they go.</dd>
  <dt><b>2000-07-18-18:27 Expand Readings (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I took apart a working bibliography for <a href="http://miser-theory.info/" target="_top"> The Miser
    Project</a>, and a few items
    made their way back here.<br>
    1. I started a <a href="sysarch.htm">System Architecture and Design</a>
    readings page and a <a href="compsci.htm">Computer Science</a> readings
    page.<br>
    2. I am ending up with a bibliography that is divided up in arbitrary
    categories and also distributed among projects on <b><code>infonuovo.com</code></b>.&nbsp; I may
    not like how this goes, but it is what I am doing for now.<br>
    3. I finally created a default page, and used it to list the
    &quot;readings&quot; that there are so far.<br>
    4. I tidied up the quality page and made all of the pages uniform.</dd>
  <dt><strong>2000-07-18-14:17 Create orcmid/reading Project &amp; Construction Log (orcmid)</strong></dt>
  <dd>1. The orcmid reading project is created to provide a place for notes,
    bibliographies, and reviews of material that I find valuable in the work of
    InfoNuovo and the projects carried on infonuovo.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>
    2. I established an index.htm and this construction.log to provide the
    initial construction structure.<br>
    3. The initial content consists of two bibliographies.&nbsp; One on
    materials addressing quality processes, another on the general computing
    milieu.&nbsp; These bibliographies are also intended to support more
    specialized references and notes in individual projects, such as <a href="http://miser-theory.info/" target="_top">The
    Miser Project</a>.<br>
    4. This collection continues the idea of using random Web-page names for
    material that is not intended to be cross-referenced and which may be of an
    ephemeral character (such as <a href="R000701.htm">BXn9rCKW.htm</a> was
    originally).&nbsp;
    It also means that agents (robots) and trollers can't find these pages by guessing
    their names.&nbsp; It is necessary to know the link.&nbsp; At some point, I
    may drive myself crazy with this stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
