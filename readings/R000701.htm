  <p>I didn't find this section particularly exciting, and my experience of the
  history of computing is different, though I can confirm some of this.</p>

  <p>Here are two things that stand out for me.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Connecting to the physical world (pp.15-17)</h2>

<blockquote>

    <p>Looking ahead 50 years, the authors observe that &quot;we know of no
      technology in 1997 to attack paper's broad use!&quot;</p>
  

  <p>&quot;One can argue that paper (and the notion of the human interpretation
  of paper-stored programs such as algorithms, contracts [laws and wills],
  directions, handbooks, maps, recipes, and stories) was our first
  computer.&nbsp; ... Programs and their human interpreters are like the
  'Harvard' computer architecture, which clearly separated program and data.</p>
  

  <p>&quot;In 1997, magnetic tape has a projected lifetime of fifteen years; CDs
  are estimated to last fifty years provided one can find the reader, and
  microfilm is projected to last two hundred years (though unfortunately,
  computers can't read it yet) and acid-free paper over five hundred years.</p>
  

  <p>&quot;The potential to reduce the use of paper introduces a significant
  problem:</p>
  

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">How are we going to ensure accessibility of the information,
    including the platforms and programs we create in fifty or five hundred
    years that our ancestors had the luck or good fortune of providing with
    paper?&nbsp; How are we even going to assure accessibility of today's HTML
    references over the next five decades?&quot;</p>
  

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="left">Networks: A convergence and interoperability among all nets
(p.17)</h2>
  

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Metcalfe's Law is introduced.&nbsp; It is very interesting:</p>
  

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The total value of a network is proportional to the square
      of the number of subscribers.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The value of a network to a single subscriber is
      proportional to the number of subscribers.</li>
  </ul>
