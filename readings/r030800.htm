<p>My short title for these notes is now &quot;Situating Cognition,&quot; since it
        is something we do.&nbsp; In <i>Understanding Computers and Cognition</i>,
Winograd and Flores identify some apparent errors in our naive
        approach to that [<a href="#Winograd1986">Winograd1986</a>].&nbsp; The authors
have a caution against &quot;situating,&quot; and I want to satisfy myself that
I am not committing violence to a view of cognition and computing that I wish to
speak consistently with.</p>
<p>I am also not sure about my direction here.&nbsp; I think I need to stand
back and take a simpler view.&nbsp; The key thing is that, in my work on <b><i><a href="http://nfoWare.com/" target="_top">nfoWare</a></i>
</b>and beyond, I want to speak of Situating Data, Situating XML, Situating
Java, and maybe Situating Computation, but certainly Situating Trust.&nbsp; The
topics that I have identified here look at a progression that is important to
me.&nbsp; And it may not hold together that well.&nbsp; Or, if it does, I may
need to change the nomenclature I am using just the same.</p>
<p>By the way, beyond the title here, I am not going to get into Cognition very
much, unless something in my review of notes returns me to that in section 4 or
something beyond that.</p>

        </p>


</blockquote>


<h2 align="left">1.1 Why &quot;Situating?&quot;
        </h2>


<blockquote>
  <p align="left">On May 29, 2003, I began something I had always meant to
  do:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../erudizione/MSC-JV/">learn Java</a>.&nbsp; My prior
  experience was limited to &quot;Hello, World&quot; in Microsoft Visual
  J++.&nbsp; I knew Java was the latest thing, and had become the
  academic-instruction programming language of choice.&nbsp; So, instead of
  studying Object-Oriented Programming in C++, about which I already knew more
  than I needed, I used the occasion to elect Object-Oriented Programming in
  Java for my M.Sc in IT programming requirement.
        </p>


  <p align="left">It did not take me
  long to become moderately frustrated while also excited to begin to see how
  Java works and what the underlying model of Java Object Oriented Technology
  is.&nbsp; So, I began to have fun and also be dismayed about how &quot;unsituated&quot;
  the treatment of Java is in particular and instruction about programming is in
  general.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">I took this as an opportunity for me to contribute
  something.&nbsp; It seems to me that we somehow skip a step and burden the
  Java neophyte with an absence of grounding (as if OOT excuses us from having
  to do that), and the result is even more confusing than use of conventional
  simpler languages (such as C).
        </p>


  <p align="left">Although I had wanted to call what I created &quot;Java Inside
  Out,&quot; that family of titles is already over-used.&nbsp; &quot;Situating
  Java&quot; was my second choice, but it grew on me.
        </p>


</blockquote>


  <h2 align="left">1.2 Situating Meaning
        </h2>


<blockquote>


  <p align="left">On August 7, 2003, I began something else I had been meaning
  to do: dig into the full array of XML specifications.&nbsp; I did that by
  electing the new <a href="../erudizione/MSC-WA/">Web Applications</a> module
  as part of my M.Sc in IT studies.
        </p>


  <p align="left">I wasn't far into this module when I realized that the
  situation of XML was perhaps even more important than situating of Java.&nbsp;
  First, they are both alleged to rely on Unicode.&nbsp; Secondly, the futures
  of XML and Java application are heavily intertwined in the Web Services
  area.&nbsp; And, somewhere, the conceits that XML is (1) self-describing and
  (2) conveys meaning, are bought into without questioning.&nbsp; (I have also
  used &quot;self-describing&quot; in ways that I now see as ridiculous.)
        </p>


  <p align="left">There were even more startling observations, having to do with
  the assumption that the syntax (or signature) of an interface is sufficient to
  define an API.&nbsp; And then there is the &quot;Semantic
  Web.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">I had already been reading [<a href="#Winograd1986">Winograd1986</a>],
  so it was natural to add &quot;Situating XML&quot; to my job jar of projects.
        </p>


</blockquote>
<h2 align="left">1.3 Situating Data
        </h2>


<blockquote>
  <p align="left">In a way, much of what there is to say about how XML relates
  to meaning is about how data and digital media have anything to do with
  language.&nbsp; I already knew that the way that columns are named in
  relational-database tables is not exactly self-describing or even adequately
  descriptive.&nbsp; Put simply, the computer (or RDBMS) doesn't know what we
  are talking about and it is not clear that we do either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">Nevertheless, on October 16, 2003 I began a <a href="../erudizione/MSC-DB/">course
  on Databases</a> as one of my M.Sc in IT required courses.&nbsp; It was
  predictable that I would run into problems of semantics and situation of
  meaning here as well.&nbsp; I found database systems to be surprisingly
  undisciplined and incoherent.&nbsp; That is not a project that I want to take
  on.&nbsp; I did have the pleasure of digging out E. F. Codd's foundational
  papers on relational database systems.&nbsp; But I am going to situate data at
  a level that supports XML and programming systems (and database systems)
  without taking on the problem of what data the data in a RDBMS &quot;is,&quot;
  &quot;represents&quot; or otherwise signifies.&nbsp; That's just too
  much.&nbsp; I may have to say something about it, but not yet.&nbsp;
  Meanwhile, I have Bill Kent's <i>Data and Reality</i>, and that will be
  helpful.
        </p>


</blockquote>
<h2 align="left">1.4 Situating Considered Harmful
        </h2>


<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Now, what to do about the cautionary aspect of
  &quot;situation&quot; in <i>Understanding Computers and Cognition</i>?
        </p>


  <p align="left">1. The pitfall appears to be in the assumption that there are
  objectively-classifiable situations in the world [<a href="#Winograd1986">Winograd1986</a>:
  5.5 p.69].&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>


  <p align="left">2. See if how I am using &quot;situating&quot; is useful or
  not.
        </p>


  <p align="left">3. Then use it anyhow, with a promise to be careful and
  attentive.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [dh:2002-12-02] I have been reading of professional
      development and preparing to participate in an <a href="http://www.kitcampus.com/programmes/msc.phtml" target="_top">on-line
      M.Sc</a> program.&nbsp; We are using <a href="http://www.centrinity.com/" target="_top">computer-mediated
      communication</a> in an asynchronous learning model.&nbsp; In looking at
      how we might develop collaboration, I was reminded of recent articles by
      Peter Denning and that brought me back here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We conclude here by pointing out that
      computer tools themselves are only part of the picture.&nbsp; The gain
      from applying conversation theory in organizations has to do with
      developing the communicative competence, norms, and rules for the
      organization, including the training to develop the appropriate
      understanding.&nbsp; This includes the proper terminology, skills, and
      procedures to recognize what is missing, deteriorated, or obtruding (i.e.,
      what is broken-down), and the ability to cope with the situation.&quot; --
      p.162, section 11.5, Tools for Conversation.</font></dd>
    <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take it that we might refer
      to &quot;community of practice&quot; in this context.&nbsp; The authors
      seem to go far beyond the establishment of a craft, however, continuing to
      say: &quot;People have experience in everyday dealing with others and with
      situations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are different levels of
      competence.&nbsp; Competence here does not mean correct grammatical usage
      or diction, but successful dealing with the world, good managerial
      abilities, and responsibility and care for others.&nbsp; Communicative
      competence means the capacity to express one's intentions and take
      responsibilities in the networks of commitments that utterances and their
      interpretations bring to the world.&nbsp; In their day-to-day being,
      people are generally not aware of what they are doing.&nbsp; They are
      simply working, speaking, etc., more or less blind to the pervasiveness of
      the essential dimensions of commitment.&nbsp; Consequently, there exists a
      domain for education in communicative competence: the fundamental
      relationship between language and successful action.&nbsp; People's
      conscious knowledge of their participation in the network of commitment
      can be reinforced and developed, improving their capacity to act in the
      domain of language.&quot; --p.162, section 11.5, Tools for Conversation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [dh:2003-08-04] I was reading one more inspiring
      article by Peter Denning, who refers to this material and related work in
      his &quot;The Profession of IT&quot; column in <i>Communications of the
      ACM</i>.&nbsp; I started browsing in Chapter 12 and I was enthralled by
      the view of design enough to promise myself to read the book all the way
      through.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found one of the cleanest popular expositions of
      ideas about existence in language and a wonderful description of the
      confluence of principles identified by Heidegger, Austin, and Maturana.&nbsp;
      I have been pondering how to approach <i>situating</i> computing and
      dealing with what it is we are doing with computers and how that relates
      to language and who <i>we</i> are with language.&nbsp; I see much that can
      be used in the calibration of my efforts, especially in being careful not
      to make over-reaching claims or interpretations of what is accomplished in
      proposing to situate computing.&nbsp; (It is basically about having a
      disciplined way to look at what it is we are computing <i>for </i>as well
      as what the mechanisms, processes, and instruments of the activity <i>are</i>
      -- appropriately distinguished and qualified.)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I have much to digest and review
      (witnessed by all of the colorful post-its flowering from the margins of
      my copy), I do notice that there are a couple of positions taken that I am
      hesitant to concede have been fully demonstrated, though I have no idea
      what would constitute such a demonstration.&nbsp; The following seems
      crucial: &quot;A computer can never enter into a commitment (although it
      can be a medium in which the commitments of its designers are conveyed),
      and can never enter as a participant into the domain of human discourse.
      ... Even the ability to utter a 'true statement' emerges from the
      potential for commitment, and the absence of this potential gives
      computers a wholly different kind of being.&quot; (8.5: p.106).&nbsp; This
      is predicated on the notion that computers &quot;are incapable of making
      commitments and cannot themselves enter into language.&quot; (6.4,
      p.76).&nbsp; It is difficult for me to imagine exactly how one could
      establish being for a computing system in a way where this was possible,
      but I don't see the basis for &quot;never&quot; here.&nbsp; I will
      continue my exploration.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However I become satisfied about that question,
      the value of this book for me is unquestionable.&nbsp; In particular, I
      can see the power of this perspective in addressing what it is we can do
      well with computers and how to demonstrate when we have done that.</font></dd>
