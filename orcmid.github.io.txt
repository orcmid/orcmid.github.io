              ORCMID GITHUB ANCHOR SCAFFOLDING/DOCUMENTATION
              ----------------------------------------------

    The GitHub project orcmid.github.io is created, by convention, to
    anchor documentation files published as GitHub pages from various
    GitHub/orcmid projects.

    Although the documentation provided in docs/ folders of projects
    will appear under https://orcmid.github.io/ as subfolders, they
    are not visible directly within this special repository.

    The only direct materials here are those intended
    to address overall matters and provide some documentation-only
    materials, such as in the bib/ and orcmid/ sub-folders.

TODO

 * Find the best "What's an Orcmid?" page and account.

 * See if nfoCentrale.com level has some useful material to mirror/continue
   here.

 * Material at this level is reachable from anchored docs/ sources and there
   can be relative references up into this level.

 * Decide quickly about where to put "What's an Orcmid" so that preservation
   elsewhere will function properly.

 * Bring Orcmid's Lair readings/ here, perhaps as bib/, depending on who uses
   what.

 * In order to have reliable maintenance of the bibliographies, it would be
   useful to have them all in one place.  This does make for longer links,
   but they can still be relative.  In that case, bib/ is superior to
   readings/.  That takes care of the maintenance problems.  I wonder what it
   does for referencing from anchored sites though.  It would be nice to tie
   in bibliographical material elsewhere, such as
   <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060101/b/>.

 * I've concluded that preserving/transposing construction structure here is
   worthwhile now that I have FrontPage available to do the work.  It takes
   care, and I am thrilled about the prospect.

 * Setup construction structure the anchor level and work through the
   preservation process in construction/ here.

 * Find a way to treat the subprojects separately, so there does need to be
   some anchor provision.  This decouples the maintenance of anchored-docs
   from each other and the anchor level.

 * See if there is something in the former anchor page, c000002.htm, that
   applies to this.
