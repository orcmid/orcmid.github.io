              ORCMID GITHUB ANCHOR SCAFFOLDING/DOCUMENTATION
              ----------------------------------------------

    The GitHub project orcmid.github.io is created, by convention, to
    anchor documentation files published as GitHub pages from various
    github/orcmid projects.

    Although the documentation provided in docs/ folders of projects
    will appear under https://orcmid.github.io/ as subfolders, they
    are not visible directly on this special project.

    The only direct materials beyond README.md here are those intended
    to address overall matters and provide some documentation-only
    materials, such as in the orcmid/ folder.

    Some material here will be referenced from "subordinate" projects.

    This level may also serve to preserve some nfoCentrale.com anchor
    materials and materials from retired domains originally housed at
    that anchor site.

TODO

 * Identify any further folders specific to the anchor.

 * Identify folders that are merged

 * Add an orcmid/ subfolder for overall information about Orcmid.

 * Find the best "What's an Orcmid?" page and account.

 * See if nfoCentrale.com level has some useful material to mirror/continue
   here.

 * I need orcmid/readings here using the shared/branched/host folder trick
   in VXP2.  I can then resolve where I want readings distributed.  I think
   having readings at the top level here might be more helpful.  Some of the
   materials are global to different projects and others are just about
   orcmid.  The common maintenance is difficult.  The referencing and cross-
   referencing is tricky.

 * Check to see if relative URLs work from project docs/ GitHub Pages to this
   orcmid.github.io level.

 * I must reconcile preservation here, especially the technical materials from
   orcmid.com and elsewhere, on fundamental shared content in preservation
   locations.

 * Decide quickly about where to put "What's an Orcmid" so that preservation
   elsewhere will function properly.

 * Figure out how cross-references will work among former readings/ folders
   too.

 * I'm conflicted about elevating orcmid to here, and/or not providing any
   construction/ here, since docEng/ will cover most of it as will the
   individual orcmid/ and miser/ folders if I want.

 * Part of this quandary has to do with splitting up Orcmid's readings/ even
   more than just between orcmid/ and miser/.  Also, I realize they need to
   be curated better, and there is room for many additions.  I'm also happy
   about how these have been authored in FrontPage and I am inclined to
   preserve that, with all of its limitations.  It will take considerable
   improvement before I would use a framework for these.

 * And I still do not know whether the best consolidation is at
   orcmid.github.io/bib rather than orcmid.github.io/orcmid/bib or /readings
