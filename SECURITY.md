## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface,
please use the GitHub vulerability reporting provision of a specific
project's Security tab, such as
[orcmid.github.io Security](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security)
when specifically about a particular project/repository (such as for `orcmid.github.io`
directly here).

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication,
send a digitally-signed plaintext email to [orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an ASCII-armored file
PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
