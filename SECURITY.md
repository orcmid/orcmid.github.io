## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface,
please use the GitHub vulnerability reporting provision of a specific
project's Security tab, such as
[orcmid.github.io Security](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security),
for `orcmid.github.io` specifically/overall.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication,
send a digitally-signed plaintext email to [orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key. If you wish encrypted responses, also sign that email in order for
your public key to be known.
