## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Please report vulnerability discoveries at the specific
GitHub repository for software having the suspected/detected security

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface,
please use the GitHub vulnerability reporting provision of a specific
project's Security tab, such as
[orcmid.github.io Security](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security),
for `orcmid.github.io` specifically/overall.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

If you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before encryption in order
for your public key to be available for that purpose.
