**2024-09-28 Status**: There are no code releases at the
[orcmid.github.io](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io)
repository/project.  Content consists of HTML, Markdown, and text files
published as GitHub Pages to [Orcmid on GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io).

GitHub automatically anchors the documentation (`docs/`) GitHub Pages for
other Orcmid on Github projects in subordinate directories, such as for
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) and
[The Miser Project on GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io/miser).

Distinct projects of [Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/)
have separate and specific Security Policy statements, vulnerability reports,
and instructions for reporting vulerabilities.  Consult **those** repository
Security tabs and/or `SECURITY.md` files for specific policies, vulnerability
reports, and ways to report a vulnerability for a given repository/release.

## Supported Versions

At the top-level
[orcmid.github.io](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io) there are no
code releases whatsoever.  There are only materials used to generate static
GitHub Pages.  **Subordinate individual projects** have project-specific
security policies and the pertinent one should be consulted.

## Finding Vulnerability Reports

The Security Tabs on GitHub repository pages provide a link to all public
reports on resolved vulnerabilities, including their nature, any mitigation,
and any actions required by those who are employing vulnerable software
versions.  These reports are developed privately in response to notification
of a vulnerability and not published until any remediation is in place.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Please report vulnerability discoveries at the specific
GitHub repository for software having the suspected/detected security
defect. That is where analysis, resolution, and publication of any
vulnerability announcement must occur.**

The identification of vulnerabilities and operation in conjunction with a
Security Policy is designed by GitHub for use by security researchers.
Knowlege of practices around handling and resolution of security issues is expected, including use of the Cybersecurity Vulnerability and Exposures
([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures))
identifiers and associated reports, and of the Common Weakness Scoring System
([CVSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)).




*Already-issued vulnerability announcements are found via the Security
tab of specific [Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/) project
repositories.*

********************  CONTINUE BELOW HERE *******************************



To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface,
please use the GitHub vulnerability reporting provision of a specific
project's Security tab, such as
[orcmid.github.io Security](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security),
for `orcmid.github.io` specifically/overall.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

If you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before encryption in order
for your public key to be available for that purpose.
