## About the Orcmid on GitHub Security-Policy Sandbox

Individual projects of [Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/)
have separate and specific Security Policy statements, vulnerability reports,
and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.  Consult **those** repository
Security tabs and/or `SECURITY.md` files for their specific policies and
reporting procedures.  The same applies for the project repositories of
others.

The Security Policy Sandbox is provided for completeness, as a safeguard, and
as an example.  Use the sandbox for familiarization and practice with security
advisories and the vulnerability reporting process.

The [Orcmid GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html) web page
is the text of the Enabled Security policy. To inspect the complete sandbox,
with or without reporting a vulnerability, access the
[Security-Policy Sandbox](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security)
tab.

The following material applies to the
[orcmid.github.io](https://orcmid.github.io) project and its web site.  It
demonstrates the pattern of all Orcmid on GitHub security policies.

## Supported Versions

## Finding Vulnerability Announcements

Public vulnerability announcements confirm vulnerabilities, reporting their
nature, their mitigation, and any actions required by those who may be
employing vulnerable software versions. Occassionally, a vulnerability
announcement can explain why a particular situation does not qualify as a
vulnerability.

*Already-issued vulnerability announcements are found via the Security
tab of specific [Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/) project
repositories.*  Practice announcements are identified as such wherever they
occur.

Vulnerability announcements for the sandbox are identified as Practice
announcements.  In the unlikely case that an actual vulnerability applies
at this level of Orcmid on GitHub, the title will reveal that case.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Please report vulnerability discoveries at the specific
GitHub repository for software having the suspected/detected cybersecurity
defect. That is where analysis, resolution, and any vulnerability announcement
must occur.  It is safe to practice with the reporting procedure here.  A
report that applies to a different repository anywhere is not acceptable.**

### What to Expect

Being a cybersecurity expert is *not* a requirement for reporting an observed
vulnerability. The form provided for entering a vulnerability report is
structured for use by cybersecurity experts as well as others.

An initial vulnerability report can be very simple:

- Reporters must have a GitHub account and be logged into GitHub to submit
a report.
- English language is required, even if very brief.
- A title must be chosen for the report.  For a practice report, please
include the word PRACTICE in the title.
- There must be a brief description of the identified vulnerability.  This can
be a simple statement.  This is also where any non-English communication
should be requested.
- There must be an "ecosystem" choice.  It is not necessary to know what
that is.  The "other" entry is always appropriate.

Other entries are *optional*.  they depend upon knowledge of expert
practices around handling and resolution of security issues,
including use of the Cybersecurity Vulnerability and Exposures
([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures))
identifiers and associated reports, and use of the Common Weakness Scoring
System
([CVSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)).

### The Simplest Path

When there is an established Security Policy, the page displayed for the
repository's Security tab will have a "Report a vulnerability" button.

![Report a vulnerability](https://orcmid.github.io/images/report-button.png)

#### Click the button.  An Advisory Details form will open.

![Describe vulnerability](https://orcmid.github.io/images/describe-vuln.png)

#### Provide a Title and enter a simple Summary.

If you have additional information, use the topics that are listed;
otherwise, leave remaining topics in the template unchanged.

#### Scroll down in the page to the "Affected products" topic.

The "Select an ecosystem" item provides a pull-down when clicked.

![Ecosystem Selection](https://orcmid.github.io/images/Ecosystem-Other.png)

#### For Orcmid on GitHub, "Other" is always a good selection.

After you submit the form, there is a confirmation and invitation to
be credited with the report.

#### Further discussion occurs with private messages to your GitHub account.

### Alternative Secure Communication

If you are unable to exercise the GitHub vulnerability reporting capability,
or prefer private secure communication, send an ASCII-armored PGP-encrypted
report in a plaintext email to [orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).  Use the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

Provide equivalent information to that solicited in the Report Description
of the Vulnerability Report form.
