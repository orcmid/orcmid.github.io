## About the Orcmid on GitHub Security-Policy Sandbox

Individual projects of [Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/)
have separate and specific Security Policy statements, vulnerability reports,
and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.  Consult **those** repository
Security tabs and/or `SECURITY.md` files for their specific policies and
reporting procedures.  The same applies for the project repositories of
others.

Review
[GitHub Guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities)
for  details of GitHub support for secure reporting and handling
of vulnerabilities.

The material below applies to the
[orcmid.github.io](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io) project
repository and the web pages produced from that repository.  It follows
the pattern of all Orcmid on GitHub project repository security policies.

## Welcome to the Sandbox

The Security Policy Sandbox is provided for completeness, as a safeguard, and
as an example.  Use the sandbox for familiarization and practice with security
advisories and the vulnerability reporting process.

The web page
[https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html](https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html)
 provides the same Security Policy statement that can be viewed via the
[orcmid.github.io security tab](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security).

## Supported Versions (Sandbox case)

**2024-11-06 Status**: There are no code releases at the
[orcmid.github.io](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io)
repository/project.  Content consists of HTML, Markdown, images, and text
files published as static GitHub Pages to the
[Orcmid on GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io) web site.  See the project
[README](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/blob/master/README.md)
for further details.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| none    | :x:                |

## Finding Vulnerability Announcements

Public vulnerability announcements confirm vulnerabilities, reporting their
nature, their mitigation, and any actions required by those who may be
employing vulnerable software versions. Occassionally, a vulnerability
announcement can explain why a particular situation does not qualify as a
vulnerability.

Find already-issued public vulnerability announcements, if any, for the
`orcmid.github.io` project/repository at
[orcmid.github.io advisories](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security/advisories).

Draft vulnerability announcements for sandbox exercises are identified as
PRACTICE announcements.  They are not published.  They are only visible to
their reporter and the managers of the repository.

In the unlikely case that an actual vulnerability arises at the
`orcmid.github.io` repository, its public announcement will be listed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Please report vulnerability discoveries at the specific
GitHub repository for software having the suspected/detected cybersecurity
defect.** That is where analysis, resolution, and any vulnerability
announcement must occur.  Use the Sandbox only for practice and trial
submissions to observe how the process works.

*There is no support for vulnerabilities of independently-released
distributions of modified forks, clones, or other derivatives provided by
others.*  It can be worthwhile to confirm that a derivative's
vulnerability does not arise from the origin Orcmid on GitHub project; when
that is the case, no support is available and any vulnerability announcement
here will reflect that conclusion.

### What to Expect

Being a cybersecurity expert is *not* a requirement for reporting an observed
vulnerability.

Although the form provided for entering a vulnerability report is
structured for use by cybersecurity experts as well as non-experts,
an initial vulnerability report can be very simple:

- Reporters must have a GitHub account and be logged into GitHub to submit
a report.
- English language is required, even if very brief.
- A title must be chosen for the report.  For a practice report, please
include the word PRACTICE in the title.
- There must be a brief description of the identified vulnerability.  This can
be a simple statement.  This is also where any non-English communication
should be requested.
- There must be an "ecosystem" choice.  It is not necessary to know what
that is.  The "Other" ecosystem entry is always appropriate.

Other details and entries are *optional*.  Some depend on expert knowledge and
practices around cybersecurity procedures, including use of the Cybersecurity
Vulnerability and Exposures
([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures))
identifiers and associated reports, and use of the Common Weakness Scoring
System
([CVSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)).

### The Simplest Path

Where there is an established Security Policy, the page displayed for the
repository's Security tab will have a "Report a vulnerability" button.

![Report a vulnerability](https://orcmid.github.io/images/report-button.png)

#### Click the button.  An Advisory Details form template will open.

![Describe vulnerability](https://orcmid.github.io/images/describe-vuln.png)

#### Provide a Title and enter a simple Summary.

If you have additional information, use the topics that are listed;
otherwise, leave remaining topics in the template unchanged.

#### Scroll down in the page to the "Affected products" topic.

The "Select an ecosystem" item provides a pull-down when clicked.

![Ecosystem Selection](https://orcmid.github.io/images/Ecosystem-Other.png)

#### For Orcmid on GitHub, "Other" is always a good selection.

Scroll down to the bottom of the form and click the "Submit report" button.

![Submit report](https://orcmid.github.io/images/Submit-vuln.png)

#### After you submit the form, there is a confirmation and invitation

![Report Confirmation](https://orcmid.github.io/images/ReportConfirmation.png)

#### Further discussion occurs with private messages to your GitHub account.

### Alternative Secure Communication

An alternative is available for those equipped to use PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) public key cryptography features.

For direct private secure communication, send an ASCII-armored
PGP-encrypted report in a plaintext email to [orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).
Download and use the
[orcmid Apache public key](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc).

**DO NOT REVEAL anything about the vulnerability in the Subject or text of
that email.**

In the encrypted text, provide equivalent information to that solicited in
the Description portion of the Vulnerability Report template.
