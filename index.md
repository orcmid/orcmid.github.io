# Welcome to Orcmid's GitHub Projects

This page is published from GitHub repository `orcmid.github.io`.
This is the anchor for GitHub orcmid projects/repositories that have GitHub
Pages documentation (docs/) folders.  The repository for this level is
[Orcmid's orcmid.github.io](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io)

The purpose of organizing at this level is related to document engineering.
I prefer to have common construction conventions and materials documented in
a single place.  That would be here.

## Orcmid's Table of Content

This `orcmid.github.io` web is organized in topical sections. Subfolders
corresponding to GitHub Pages of Orcmid projects/repositories are in different
stages of construction and readiness.
