## A Little Tap Dance

GitHub is relied upon for backup and preservation of software development,
releases, and maintenance.  Change-tracking and any recoveries of backups is
accomplished via git, as is any coordination of submission by multiple
contributors.  There is also useful support for publication of project
activity and documentation on the web.  That's how pages of this site are
published.

This site is an anchorage for documentation of writings and several projects.
Orcmid GitHub projects are documented individually yet published together as
of this site. This handy feature of GitHub that may be of interest to others
in developing documentation and publishing web sites.

When [Orcmid GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid) repositories are documented
using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (e.g., via `docs/` folders),
those published GitHub Pages are moored as sections (e.g.,
[orcmid.github.io/miser](https://orcmid.github.io/miser)).  There are also
sections, such as [bib](bib/) authored directly here.

Anchorage materials such as this page are authored at
[Orcmid's orcmid.github.io project](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io)
and published as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  GitHub recognizes
the coincidence of repository and the default web site name for the orcmid
GitHub account.  More about such applications of GitHub are at
[docEng](docEng/).

I invite discussion about `orcmid.github.io` topics in the

Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/issues).  There
