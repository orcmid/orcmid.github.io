<p align="left">These pages provide for the Atom Site Feed entries used in making the
following announcements in the Orcmid's Lair blog feed:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b><a href="C000011B.htm">C000011B</a>: Test Announcement</b>.&nbsp;
    This entry is inserted in the feed as a warning that tests are in progress
    and the feed may be disrupted by them.&nbsp; This entry is advanced (given a new number) and added to the current feed as
    the most-recent entry. This will cause a warning entry to be seen as the
    latest content of the feed.&nbsp; Being manually injected, the entry will
    disappear following an automated regeneration of the feed, although
    retrieved copies of it will persist.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b><a href="C000011C.htm">C000011C</a>: Standby Announcement</b>.&nbsp;
    This is a complete replacement for the feed that injects a standby
    announcement as part of early incident-response activity.&nbsp; It is more
    important that there be a good feed in place of a (potentially) corrupted
    one.&nbsp; It might not be accurate, although it will be during
    testing.&nbsp; This XML document is pre-advanced and stored in place of the current
    feed document.&nbsp; It
    accomplishes two things.&nbsp; It makes a &quot;Please Stand By&quot; entry
    available as its only content.&nbsp; It makes a valid feed file for access
    even if it is not recognized as a new change, so that feed subscribers will
    not encounter a corrupted feed file.&nbsp; This announcement will disappear
    as soon as a better feed document is restored, whether manually or through
    automated generation.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b><a href="C000011D.htm">C000011D</a>: All-Clear Announcement</b>.&nbsp;
    This entry is inserted manually into the feed as an all-clear announcement
    following testing.&nbsp; It is not used as part of a non-testing situation. This entry is advanced (given a new number) and added to the current feed
    (not the standby announcement, usually) to declare a test condition as
    completed.</li>
</ul>

    <p align="left">These pages do not provide the XML documents, they provide
    the HTML pages that the &quot;identities&quot; (that is, the
    &lt;id&gt;-elements) of the feed entries are tied to.&nbsp; The pages also
    identify how the element is formed and used.&nbsp; This is not totally
    satisfying, and it will do for now.&nbsp; [The unsatisfying part is that it
    is from my point of view working in the solution space, rather from the view
    of a visitor who encounters one of these entries in the problem space they
    live in.]

<p align="left">The reason for advancing the identity and the title of the
entries is so aggregation software will not confuse a test announcement and the ensuing
all-clear announcement as being updates of previous announcements.&nbsp; It is
less critical that the standby announcements be kept unique, but it is done for
consistency.<p align="left">Because standby announcements are set up to be
applied quickly, without any preparation, the identification of their solo entry
is incremented after use, not
before.&nbsp; A standby announcement is always &quot;hot&quot; and ready to be
applied.<p align="left">If there become multiple feeds on this site, there will
need to be a separate set of master feed announcements for each one.&nbsp; That
is because entries are identified with particular feeds to ensure they are
recognized and that aggregation software is not mislead by recurrence of an
identification (or title).&nbsp;&nbsp;
