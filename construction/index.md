This Construction Material portion of `orcmid.github.io` provides a record of
the tools and techniques by which the overall web site and its immediate
subfolders (e.g., [orcmid](../orcmid))
are maintained and operated.  Construction structure of GitHub Pages
(`docs/` folders) for individual projects/repositories on
[Orcmid's GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid) is provided in those
repositories.

The Construction Material section has a
[construction structure](construction.txt) and a top-level construction zone.
There's management of the documentation's construction and and also
scaffolding for the Construction Material itself.
