<title>c000003c: Construction-Structure Hard-Hat Image</title>

<!-- This page is used by FrontPage "Include Page" components on construction-structure pages of
     this site.  There is nothing in the body but what we want included.  For the present 
     page, the body contains an image href to be placed in the left cell of the Construction 
     Block on the pages.  Any editing of the image and the link is done on this page
     and the changes are automatically propogated to all other pages that include this page.
     This block is not appropriate on every construction-structure page, because it always 
     links to the construction shack.  When a different link is appropriate for navigation of
     the construction structure, hand-built versions are included.  It would be nice to have
     a different, anchor-insensitive scheme for this.

<!-- This page provides the standard hard-hat section image inclusion for the construction-
  structure pages of this site.  It depends on relative location for the image and
  for the Hard Hat area, which is taken to be the front-page construction zone of the overall site.
