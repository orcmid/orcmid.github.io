<!-- This page is used by FrontPage "Include Page" components on undecorated pages of standard 
     site sections.  There is nothing in the body but what we want included.  For the present page,
     the body contains an image href to be placed in the left cell of the Title Block on standard
     pages.  This image will then appear exactly the way we want.  Editing of the image is not
     done in the pages that include the component.  Instead, the image is edited on this page
     and the changes will be automatically propogated to all other pages that include this page.
