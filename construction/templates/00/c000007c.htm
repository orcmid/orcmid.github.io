     the body contains an image href to be placed in the left cell of the Title Block on standard
     pages.  This image will then appear exactly the way we want.  Editing of the image is not
     done in the pages that include the component.  Instead, the image is edited on this page
     and the changes will be automatically propogated to all other pages that include this page.
