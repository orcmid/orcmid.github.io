             ORCMID GITHUB DOCUMENTATION CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
             -------------------------------------------------

    The Construction Material portion of orcmid.github.io collects overall
    Construction/Document-Engineering materials that are common to all of
    the  documented projects/repositories at <https://github.cm/orcmid>.

    This Material is a hybrid of Orcmid's Lair construction adjusted for
    this location and current arrangements.

                  and refactored as appropriate.  These are not checked-in
                  until I know what's worth keeping.

TODO

 * Populate a construction catalog, maybe looking to docEng for more.

 * Decide about updating the ClustrMap and also having a ClustrMap for
   orcmid.github.io.

 * Bring the site-repaving for Orcmid's Lair to here.  Maybe all of the
   construction structure for orcmid should be upleveled to here.

 * Setup the github.io construction level to work for all of the direct
   folder here, including this one.  This establishes where readings/ go,
   whatever their name.
