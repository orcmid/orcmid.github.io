              ORCMID'S GOLDEN CAREER THROUGH COMPUTER SCIENCE
              -----------------------------------------------

    I gave myself the GoldenGeek moniker when I reached the 50th anniversary
    of my first line of code.  That program was around May of 1958, it was in
    original Fortran, and running it caused a divide check on the IBM 704
    at Boeing in Seattle.

    Since I am creating this file in November of 2025, it has now been over 67
    years, testament to me being a slow learner.

NOTES AND TODOS

 * On 2007-02-15 (#57.70) I have a note on Peter Naur and Science as
   Explanation.  That's maybe more metaphor, analogy, etc.  In the note
   I mention Kurt Cagle and checking in Comm.ACM letters. I also mention
   a W040400 (would be under bib/ now, perhaps) on "Risks of Risks
   Speculations", my Ariane 501 analysis.

 * On 2007-02-15 (#57.70) I also specify getting back to W060301 on
   appreciating ALGOL 60 and the other ideas I had about that. I will get
   to that and also look into early (before GNU) open-source activities,
   academic contributons/licensing, etc.

 * On 2011-01-28 (#66.71) I observe I have been playing a game called
   Evony: Revival and devoting a lot of time, and notebook space, to playing
   the game.  This goes back into (#63)and I was very serious about this until
   I wasn't. When I gave up, I turned over properties and things to some other
   players so it must have been cooperative.  I no longer (2025-11-15) have
   any idea of the fascination, but I was deep into the game and all the time-
   based things that had to be managed.
