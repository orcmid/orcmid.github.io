# orcmid.github.io GitHub Pages

The [orcmid.github.io](https://orcmid.github.io) subdomain provides
publication of all GitHub Pages from all repositories/projects of
[Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid) that have GitHub Pages
enabled.

## Overview

This `orcmid.github.io` repository is configured so that the master branch
is taken as the authored form of GitHub Pages for publishing to the root of
the domain.  Changes and additions are automatically published when committed
to the repository.

The files and subdirectories of this project are all carried over into
published GitHub Pages.  All Markdown (`*.md`) pages will be transformed to
HTML (`*.html`) pages.  Other pages (such as `*.txt` and `*.htm`) are
published without change.

In addition, those other Orcmid on GitHub repositories that have `docs/`
folders are configured to have those folders published as subfolders of the
`orcmid.github.io` web site, such as
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) and
[miser](https://orcmid.github.io/miser), for the documentation of repositories having the same Orcmid on GitHub names.

## Creation and Maintenance

There is direct creation of HTML content (`*.htm` files) often authored using
Microsoft FrontPage.  These can be viewed from the repository using a web
browser; maintenance, however, depends on features of FrontPage.

Text files and markdown pages can be maintained with a text editor.  The
Orcmid on GitHub owner employs Visual Studio Code for those activities.

There are additional text files and some HTML files that are part of the
site creation-and-maintenance scaffolding and workflow.  See, in particular,
[index.htm](https://orcmid.github.io/index.htm) and
[orcmid.github.io.txt](https://orcmid.github.io/orcmid.github.io.txt).

## The Security Policy Sandbox

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are not expected at this level.  There are no
code releases at the `orcmid.github.io` repository/project.  Only static web
pages are produced.

However, there is a Security Policy implemented at the `orcmid.github.io`
[security tab](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security).  The
policy statement is provided for familiarization of the general approach
to cybersecurity vulnerability reporting on those Orcmid on GitHub projects
that are intended to have releases.

The Security Policy also has the "Private vulnerability reporting" feature
enabled.  In this case, the feature is available for users to see what is
required in making a private report and how interactions about the
report will take place.  It is expected that these cases will all be for
practice and preparation for reporting on another GitHub project.

The arrangement is also used to assist the manager of Orcmid on GitHub
determining that the private reporting system is functioning and can be
explained.
