# Welcome to Orcmid's GitHub Projects

This page is published from GitHub repository `orcmid.github.io` file
`README.md`.  This is a custom arrangement providing an anchor for GitHub
orcmid projects/repositories that have GitHub Pages
as documentation folders.

The purpose of organizing at this level is related to document engineering.
I prefer to have common construction conventions and materials documented in
a single place.  That would be here.  Maybe.

## Orcmid's Table of Content

The `orcmid.github.io` web is organized in topical sections. The subfolders
corresponding to GitHub Pages of Orcmid projects/repositories are in different
stages of construction and readiness.

| **Section** |  **General Topic** |
|   --:       |  ---               |
| [docEng](docEng/) | Patterns, Practices and Tools for Document Engineering |
| [miser](miser/) | The Miser Project on GitHub |
| [orcmid](orcmid/) | All about Orcmid on GitHub (or anywhere else)|
| [nfoTools](nfoTools/) | nfoWare/nfoWorks Software Tutorials and Toolkits|
| | |
| [construction](construction/) | Common Construction Materials (maybe) |

----

I invite discussion about `orcmid.github.io` topics in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/discussions).
