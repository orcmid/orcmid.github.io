# orcmid.github.io Welcome to Orcmid's GitHub Projects

This page is published from GitHub repository `orcmid.github.io` file
`README.md`.  This is a custom arrangement by GitHub that can be serves as an
anchor for other GitHub orcmid projects/repositories that have GitHub Pages
authoring folders.

I am rather unclear how to handle the existence of separately-authored
subwebs and whether there are collision cases between this top level and
the the subordinate folders corresponding to individual-project documentation.
I will experiment very carefully and trust that I won't break anything in an
irreversible manner.

The purpose of organizing at this level is related to document engineering.
I prefer to have the construction approach for web documentation of individual
projects documented in one place.  This strikes me as the obvious place.

## Orcmid's Table of Content

The `orcmid.github.io` web is organized in topical sections. The subfolders
corresponding to the GitHub Pages of Orcmid projects are in different stages
of construction and readiness.
