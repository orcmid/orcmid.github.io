# orcmid.github.io GitHub Pages

The [orcmid.github.io](https://orcmid.github.io) subdomain provides
publication of all GitHub Pages from all repositories/projects of
[Orcmid on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid) that have GitHub Pages
enabled.

## Overview

This `orcmid.github.io` repository is configured so that the master branch
is taken as the authored form of GitHub Pages for publishing to the root of
the domain.  Changes and additions are automatically published when committed
to the repository.

The files and subdirectories of this project are all carried over into
published GitHub Pages. Markdown (`*.md`) pages are transformed to
HTML (`*.html`) pages.  Other pages (such as `*.txt` and `*.htm`) are
published without change.

Other Orcmid on GitHub repositories that have `docs/`
folders are configured to have those folders published as subfolders of the
`orcmid.github.io` web site with their Orcmid on GitHub names, such as
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) and
[miser](https://orcmid.github.io/miser).

## Creation and Maintenance

There is direct creation of HTML content (`*.htm` files), often authored using
Microsoft FrontPage.  These can be viewed from the repository using a web
browser; maintenance, however, depends on features of FrontPage.

Text files and markdown pages can be maintained with a text editor.  The
Orcmid on GitHub owner employs Visual Studio Code for those activities.

There are additional text files and some HTML files that are part of the
site creation-and-maintenance scaffolding and workflow.  See, in particular,
[index.htm](https://orcmid.github.io/index.htm) and
[orcmid.github.io.txt](https://orcmid.github.io/orcmid.github.io.txt).

## The Security Policy Sandbox

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are not expected at this level.  There are no
code releases at the `orcmid.github.io` repository/project.  Only static web
pages are produced.

The
[Security Policy](https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html)
at the `orcmid.github.io`
[security tab](https://github.com/orcmid/orcmid.github.io/security) is
provided as a sandbox for familiarization and practice with GitHub's
vulnerability reporting and announcement mechanism.

The sandbox Security Policy has "Private vulnerability reporting" enabled.
Use the sandbox to inspect what's required for a report and how any remedy
and vulnerability announcement are developed in private.
